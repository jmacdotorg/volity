=head1 NAME

Volity::Server - A Volity game server.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Volity::Server;
 
 # Create a new server
 my $server = Volity::Server->new(
				 {
				  user=>'bob_the_game',
				  password=>'secret',
				  host=>'volity.net',
				  resource=>'server',
				  alias=>'volity',
				  game_class=>'MyGame::Class',
				}
				);

 # And there you go.
 $server->start;

 # ... elsewhere ...

 $server->stop;


=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object of this class is a Volity parlor. (It's still called
Volity::Server due to historical tradition.) As the synopsis suggests,
it's more or less a black-box application class. Construct the object
with a configuratory hash reference, call the C<start> method, and if
XMPP worked out, you've got a running server.

You generally never need to use this class directly, no matter what
you're doing with Volity. Parlor objects of this class are created and
managed for you by the C<volityd> program, so unless you want to get
into the guts of the Volity system you may be more interested in
L<volityd>. If you want to make your own Volity games in Perl, I
direct your attention to L<Volity::Game>.

use warnings;
use strict;

=head1 CONFIGURATION

When constructing the object, you can use all the keys described in
L<Volity::Jabber/"Accessors">, for this class inherits from that one,
you see. You can also use any of the following keys, which also
function as simple accessor methods after the object is created:

=over

=item game_class

The Perl class of the game that this server will use. It will pass it
along to all the referee objects it creates. See L<Volity::Referee>
and L<Volity::Game>.

=item bookkeeper_jid

The JID of the bookkeeper this server will use for fetching game
records and such. Defaults to "bookkeeper@volity.net", which is
probably exactly what you want.

=item contact_email

The email address of the person responsible for this server.

=item contact_jid

The Jabber ID of the person responsible for this server.

=item bot_classes

A list of the bot classes that this server's referees can use. See
L<Volity::Bot>.

=item volity_version

The version number of the Volity protocol that this server supports.

=item visible

Whether or not this parlor is visble to Volity's game finder. Set to 1
if it is, or 0 if it should go unlisted.

=item admins

A list of JIDs that are allowed to call this server's admin.* RPCs.

=back

=head1 OTHER METHODS

=over

=item start

Starts the server.

=item stop

Stops the server, and furthermore calls C<stop> on all its child
referee objects, if it has any still hanging around.

=item graceful_stop

Stops the parlor, but doesn't affect any live referees. 

=item referees

Returns a list of all server's currently active referee objects. The
server will take care of adding and removing referees from this list
as they come and go.

You can set this if you want, but it will probably break things and
you will be sad.

=item startup_time

Returns the time (in seconds since the epoch) when this palor started.

=item wall ( $message )

Every referee will "speak" $message (with the preamble "Server
message: ") into its table's groupchat.

=back

=head1 NOTES

=head2 Automatic roster acceptance

When an object of this class receives an XMPP request, it will
automatically and immediately . If you don't like this behavior,
consider creating a subclass that overrides the C<jabber_presence>
method. (That said, I can't think of a reason you'd want to have such an
antisocial game server...)
