=head1 NAME

Volity::GameRecord - Information about a completed Volity game.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use Volity::GameRecord;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object of this class represents an information record about. In
practical terms, it's an abstraction of the information that a game
referee sends to its Volity network's bookkeeper once a game has
finished. Through the methods this class provides, it's easy for a
parlor to build and sign this RPC call, and just as easy for the
receiving bookkeeper.

Note that, since RPC is the neutral middle ground, a Frivolity game
parlor (a.k.a. a Perl object of a Volity::Game::Server subclass) can
pass a Volity::GameRecord object to any Volity bookkeeper, regardless
of its platform. Similarly, A Volity::Bookkeeper object can knit a
Volity::Gamerecord object out of any game parlor's RPC request,
whether or not that parlor runs Frivolity. (In reality, this latter
situation will probably be quite common.)

=head1 USAGE

Game module designers don't have to worry about using this module at
all. Records are automatically created by Volity::Referee objects when
a game wraps up, and incoming records are automatically parsed by the
bookkeeper.

The following documentation is really here for completeness' sake, but
those wishing to modify the Frivolity referee or bookkeeper behavior
might find it interesting.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Class methods (constructors)

=over

=item new_from_hashref($hashref)

Creates a new object based on the given hash reference, typically one that
has been freshly translated from an RPC E<lt>structE<gt> argument.

For the opposite functionality, see C<render_into_hashref> under L<"Object
Methods">.

=back

=head2 Object accessors

All these are simple accessors which return the named object attribute. If
an argument is passed in, then the attribute's value is first set to that
argument.

In the case of lists, either an array or an array reference is returned,
depending upon context.

This module inherits from Class::Accessor, so all the tips and tricks
detailed in L<Class::Accessor> apply here as well.
