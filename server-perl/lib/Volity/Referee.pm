=head1 NAME

Volity::Referee - Class for in-MUC game overseers.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object of this class represents a Volity referee, the automated
process that sits in a MUC along with the players, and arbitrates the
game for them. See the general Volity documentation for a more
detailed description of how this works.

In the Frivolity system, a Volity::Server object automatically makes a
referee object and sends it to the appropriate MUC when a game
starts. The class of referee it makes depends upon the value of the
server object's C<referee_class> instance variable, but most games can
get away with using this default class, and putting all their game
logic in a Volity::Game subclass.

=head1 USAGE

=head2 For game programmers

After being instanced, your game object will have a referee object as
its C<referee> instance variable, accessible through the C<referee()>
accessor. You can call all the methods on it defined in this
manpage. However, you should avoid doing anything that would mess up
the game, such as having the referee leave the table! It's probably
more useful for accessing methods like C<groupchat()>.

In many cases, you can program your game module without ever directly
referring to the referee. It's just there if you need it (and for the
use of the lower-level Volity::Game base class, which does carry on a
continual conversation with its embedded referee object). Other than
that, the referee object takes care of all the Volity protocol-level
stuff for you, letting you concentrate on making your game work.

=head2 For wizardly game programmers

If you feel the need to subclass Volity::Referee, you can run C<volityd> with 

Note that you can use the stock Volity::Referee class for most situations.

=head2 For everyone else

Unless you're writing a game module, you can probably happily ignore
this module. The game server will use it just fine, all by itself.

=head1 METHODS

The following methods describe this module's public API (insofar as
Perl modules can say that they have any public/private
distinction). You are welcome to snoop around in the code to see what
the other, internal methods do, but you probably wouldn't need to call
them during a game.

It's worth noting that this module subclasses from Volity::Jabber, and
therefore enjoys all the methods that it defines, as well as the ones
listed here.

=head2 Object accessors

All these are simple accessors which return the named object
attribute. If an argument is passed in, then the attribute's value is
first set to that argument.

It is through these accessors that you perform most game configuration
definition, such as the maximum number of players allowed per game.

This module inherits from Class::Accessor, so all the tips and tricks
detailed in L<Class::Accessor> apply here as well.

=over

=item bookkeeper_jid

The JID of the network's bookkeeper. Initially set by the server,
depending upon its own configuration.

=item muc_jid

The JID of the table's MUC. Set by various magic internal
methods, so you should treat this as read-only; things will probably
not work well if you reset this value yourself.

=item game_class

I<Important!> The Perl class of the actual game (usually a subclass of
Volity::Game).

You I<must> set this on object construction though the C<new> method's
argument hash, as detailed in L<Volity/"Object construction">. Not
doing so will result in an error.

=item game

The referee superclass already knows how and when to create a game
object from the class specified by the C<game_class> instance
variable, and when it does so, it stores that object under C<game>.

You should treat-this as a read-only variable. Generally, it will
always be defined, as a referee creates a new game object as soon as
it can. When a game ends, the object is destroyed a new one
automatically takes its place.

Volity::Referee inherits from Volity::Jabber, and therefore uses all

METHODS">.

Don't be shy about overriding any handlers you wish, so long as you
call the parent class's handler at some point so that any special
Volity::Referee magic will be taken care of. This includes passing
chat messages along to the contained game object or class (see L<"The
