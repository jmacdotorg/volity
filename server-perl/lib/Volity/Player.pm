=head1 NAME

Volity::Player - Volity players, from a referee's perspective.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object of this class represents a Volity player present at a
table. The referee creates one of these objects for every player who
comes to that ref's table. The player might not actually I<play> the
game (i.e. sit in a seat), but is nonetheless recognized by the referee
as a potential game player and table presence.

In certain circumstances a ref may choose to keep an object for a
given player persistent, even after that player leaves the table,
while other times the player's departure results in the object's
destruction. Generally, it just does the right thing.

=head1 USAGE

You should never need to create or destroy player objects yourself;
the referee object takes care of that. However, there are a number of
methods defined by Volity::Referee and Volity::Seat that return player
objects, so you may find yourself interacting with them anyway.

Volity::Game subclasses refer to seats more often than to individual
players, since most game interaction takes place at the seat level.

=head1 METHODS

This class defines two kinds of object methods: accessors to basic,
informational attributes about the player, and triggers to send RPC
methods to the player's client.

=head2 Basic attributes

Consider these methods as read-only accessors to attributes that the
referee sets. (Well, you can write to them if you'd like, but I can't
predict what might happen if you do, so don't.)

=over

=item jid

This player's full JID.

=item basic_jid

The player's JID, minus the resource part.

=item nick

This player's MUC nickname.

=item referee

The Volity::Referee object of the table this player is at.

=item is_bot

1 if this player is a referee-created bot, 0 otherwise.

=item seat

The Volity::Seat object this player occupies. undef if the player
isn't sitting or missing.

=item state_seat

A Volity::Seat object that's most appropriate to use when sending
state to the player, preventing suspension-mode state-snooping. See
the C<send_full_state_to_player> method documented in L<Volity::Game>.

=item is_missing

1 if the player has abruptly vanished while sitting at an active game, 0 otherwise.


=back

=head2 Volity RPC methods

These methods all send volity-namespaced RPC methods to the player's client.

Generally, you shouldn't have to call any of these yourself. The ref
takes care of all this stuff.

# FIELDS:
# jid
#   This player's full jid.
# nick
#   This player's MUC nickname.
# referee
#   The Volity::Referee object of the table this player is at.
# rpc_count
#   Counter that helps generate unique RPC request IDs.
# is_bot
#   1 if this player is a referee-created bot.
# seat
#   The Volity::Seat object this player occupies.
# last_active_seat
#   The Volity::Seat object this player occupies prior to the last suspension.
# is_missing
#   1 if the player has abruptly vanished while sitting at an active game.

# basic_jid: Return the non-resource part of my JID.
sub basic_jid {
  my $self = shift;
  if (defined($self->jid) and $self->jid =~ /^(.*)\//) {

sub seat {
    my $self = shift;
    if (@_) {
	$self->{seat} = $_[0];
    }
    return $self->{seat};
}


=item call_ui_function ($function, @args)

Sends the RPC request "game.$function(@args)" from the referee to the
player's client.

I<Note> that in most cases, you'll actually want to call UI functions
on the seat level, not on individual players. Luckily, the
Volity::Seat class defines this same method, which works in the same
manner. (To tell you the truth, it just mirrors the
C<call_ui_function> call to all of the player objects it holds...)
