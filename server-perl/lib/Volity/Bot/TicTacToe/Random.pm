=head1 NAME

Volity::Bot::TicTacToe::Random - Tic tac toe bot module for Volity

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a subclass of C<Volity::Bot> that defines an automated Tic Tac
Toe player. It is not a very good Tic Tac Toe player, choosing a
random legal move to make every time its turn comes up.

More importantly, this module demonstrates how a simple Volty bot is
written in Perl. It is relatively short, and I have annotated its
source code in a way that I hope will be useful to people interested
in Volity game programming. Feel free to contact me with questions or
comments.
