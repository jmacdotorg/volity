--- WHAT IS THIS? ---

This is a very early alpha release of the Frivolity programming
libraries. 

It will, by default, install several Perl modules into your
site-perl location under the Volity namespace, and place a server
script (server.pl) and a command-line client (client.pl) in
/usr/local/volity/bin. If these location do not suit you, edit Build.PL
appropriately. (See the Module::Build manpage for instructions on
modifying this file.)

--- WHAT IS FRIVOLITY? ---

Frivolity is a free, Perl-based reference implementation of the Volity
protocol for Internet-based game play. It is released under the LGPL
open-source license. (See the accompanying LICENSE file.)

This release offers very little documentation. It's probably of very
little use to anyone but the core Volity development team, at
present. Future releases will have more, certainly.

--- PREREQUISITES ---

Frivolity requires several Perl modules to work; the Build script
checks for their presence on your system.

All are available from CPAN, except one: version 0.3.x of
POE::Component::Jabber. As of this writing (January 2004), its CPAN
version, 0.2.x, is not compatible with Frivolity. You will have to
download the more recent version from Jabber
Studio. http://www.jabberstudio.org/projects/pcj/project/view.php

--- INSTALLATION ---

This package uses the Module::Build installation style. You should be
able to set everything up like so:

 perl Build.PL

This will prompt you for various bits of information that the test
script requires, including some Jabber login information. You can
provide _any_ account information here; Volity doesn't need anything
other than ordinary Jabber magic to work, and the test suite will not
modify the given account in any way.

 ./Build

In theory you can then run:
 ./Build test

But that might not work, so you may have to instead do a 
 perl test.pl

This will work in a saner fashion soon. (Sorry.)
