--- WHAT IS THIS? ---

Frivolity is a free, Perl-based reference implementation of the Volity
platform for Internet-based game play. It is released under the LGPL
open-source license. (See the accompanying LICENSE file.)

This release offers some embedded POD documentation. However, you can
find a more complete reference on the Web here:

http://www.volity.org/docs/devguide_perl/

Unfortuately, as the webpage says, it's rather outdated. Fortunately,
this release is (I hope!) the final bugfix release before I publish
the next version of the dev guide. I hope to have that done before
November 2005.

--- PREREQUISITES ---

Frivolity requires several Perl modules to work; the Build script
checks for their presence on your system. All are available from CPAN.

--- INSTALLATION ---

This package uses the Module::Build installation style. (I'm not sure
if it will continue to do so in future releases; it's kind of annoying
and I'm not really getting much mileage out of it. But for now...)

It will, by default, install several Perl modules into your
site-perl location under the Volity namespace, and place a server
script (server.pl) and a command-line client (friv) in
/usr/local/volity/bin. If these locations do not suit you, edit Build.PL
appropriately. (See the Module::Build manpage for instructions on
modifying this file.)

Once you've set up things as you liked it (or decided you are happy
with the defaults, which is likely), you should be able to create the
build script like so:

 perl Build.PL

 ./Build

 ./Build test

You'll note there's not much in the way of testing now... it just
makes sure everything compiles. We will add some nice test suites in
the near future.

 sudo ./Build install

--- TESTING YOUR INSTALLATION WITH A SAMPLE GAME ---

While no automated testing exists yet, you can manually test your
installation by attempting to play a game of rock-paper-scissors using
Friv, a text-based Volity client included with this distribution. Friv
is located locally in bin/friv, and is installed into wherever you
specified the Build script to place scripts; by default it goes into
/usr/local/volity/bin/.

Using a valid Jabber username, host, and password, run Friv like so:

 friv -u [username] -h [host] -p [password]

Upon connection, issue the following series of commands to Friv's prompt:

> new_table rps@volity.net/volity
> add_bot
> sit
> ready
> select rock

As you do so, you should witness an entire game of rock-paper-scissors
occur between you and an automated opponent. (In fact, it should look
rather like the "SYNOPSIS" section of Friv's manpage.) If everything
looks good, congratulations; your Frivolity installation seems to be a
success! (And you can continue issuing "start_game" and "select
[hand-shape]" commands for as long as you'd like.) If something goes
wrong, please notify either me or the mailing list (see below).
