--- WHAT IS THIS? ---

This is a very early alpha release of the Frivolity programming
libraries. 

It will, by default, install several Perl modules into your
site-perl location under the Volity namespace, and place a server
script (server.pl) and a command-line client (client.pl) in
/usr/local/volity/bin. If these location do not suit you, edit Build.PL
appropriately. (See the Module::Build manpage for instructions on
modifying this file.)

--- WHAT IS FRIVOLITY? ---

Frivolity is a free, Perl-based reference implementation of the Volity
protocol for Internet-based game play. It is released under the LGPL
open-source license. (See the accompanying LICENSE file.)

This release offers very little documentation. It's probably of very
little use to anyone but the core Volity development team, at
present. Future releases will have more, certainly.

--- INSTALLATION ---

This package uses the Module::Build installation style. You should be
able to set everything up like so:
 perl Build.PL
[ then answer some questions to set up testing ]

 ./Build

In theory you can then run:
 ./Build test

But that might not work, so you may have to instead do a 
 perl test.pl

(sorry.)
