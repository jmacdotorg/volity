--- WHAT IS THIS? ---

Frivolity is a free, Perl-based reference implementation of the Volity
platform for Internet-based game play. It is released under the LGPL
open-source license. (See the accompanying LICENSE file.)

This release offers some embedded POD documentation. However, you can
find a more complete reference on the Web, here:

http://www.volity.org/docs/devguide_perl/

This release will probably be of little use to anyone but the core
Volity development team, and the handful of friends who have elected
to try programming the platform's first few "third-party" game
modules. Their feedback is sure to make future releases more mature,
and of wider reach.

If, after learning a bit about Volity, you'd like to try your hand at

days, do drop me a line: jmac@jmac.org.

--- PREREQUISITES ---

Frivolity requires several Perl modules to work; the Build script
checks for their presence on your system.

All are available from CPAN, except one: version 1.0 (tentative) of
POE::Component::Jabber. As of this writing (May 2004), its CPAN
version, 0.2.x, is not compatible with Frivolity. You will have to
download the more recent version from Jabber Studio. Fortunately, this
is pretty easy; it's a tarball that you can find here:

http://www.jabberstudio.org/projects/pcj/project/view.php

--- INSTALLATION ---

This package uses the Module::Build installation style.

It will, by default, install several Perl modules into your
site-perl location under the Volity namespace, and place a server
script (server.pl) and a command-line client (friv) in
/usr/local/volity/bin. If these locations do not suit you, edit Build.PL
appropriately. (See the Module::Build manpage for instructions on
modifying this file.)

Once you've set up things as you liked it (or decided you are happy
with the defaults, which is likely), you should be able to create the
build script like so:

 perl Build.PL

 ./Build

 ./Build test

You'll note there's not much in the way of testing now... it just
makes sure everything compiles. We will add some nice test suites in
the near future.

 sudo ./Build install
