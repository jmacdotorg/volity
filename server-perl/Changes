0.2.1
	- Servers now keep track of referees they create, and provide the
	  appropriate accessor methods. A server that receives a 'stop'
	  message will pass this along to its referees.

	- Added a 'stop' method to Server and Referee classes.

	- Added lots of POD docs throughout the package.

	- Added this Changes file to the package!

	- Added a test suite, which can be run through the 'test' command
       	  of the Build script.

	- Rubbed out various hardcoded settings in Server and Referee.

	- Changed messy debug print()s into debug() method calls.

	- Added (unfortunately) "no warnings(deprecated)" to suppress
	  whinging about bad pseudohashes. We'll eject phashes later.

	- Volity::Game now inherits from Class::Data::Inheritable, and is
	  now the place to set game configuration information such as the
	  game's URI and allowed player range.
