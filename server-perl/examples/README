The files in this directory demonstrate the subclassing needed to
create a simple, real Volity parlor in Perl -- in this case, one that
plays Tic Tac Toe.

An SVG/ECMAScript UI file is also included, even though UI creation
isn't a part of these Perl modules, and the makefile leaves them
alone. They're copies of the SVG documents that an SVG-using Volity
client would download upon joining a Tic Tac Toe table.
