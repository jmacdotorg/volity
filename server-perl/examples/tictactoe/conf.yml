# Sample config file for volityd
# This will (with a bit of customization) run a TicTacToe parlor from your
# computer. 
# Simply replace the values of the "jabber_id" and "bot_jabber_id" fields
# with a valid Jabber ID that you own, and put its password into the 
# "password" field.
# If you dont have a Jabber ID, you can use a Volity client like Javolin to
# create one, or use a Jabber client.
# To use this file with volityd, specify it on the command line through the
# -C flag, like this (assuming that volityd is in your PATH and your working
# directly contains this config file):
# volityd -C conf.yaml &
# Once the server is running, you should be able to connect to it by running
# a Volity client such as Javolin, and then sending a table-creation request
# to the parlor with the Jabber ID "${whatever_you_used_below}/volity".
