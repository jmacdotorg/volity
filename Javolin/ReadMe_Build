This document assumes that you have obtained the Javolin build environment from
the CVS repository at SourceForge.net, and wish to build Javolin or Testbench.

------------
Requirements
------------
To build Javolin, you need:
- Java 1.4.1 or higher. 
- Apache Ant; see http://ant.apache.org/ for info and download
- Various third party libraries on which Javolin depends. See the "Libraries"
section below before attempting to build Javolin.

--------
Building
--------
Currently Apache Ant is used for building Javolin. The build.xml file specifies
several commands. To invoke a command, simply execute:

ant command

at the command line, where "command" is the desired command. The following
commands are available:

  archive - Compiles Javolin and builds the Javolin.jar file. This is the
      default, so you can just execute "ant" by itself, without specifying a
      command.

  libarchive - Compiles and builds Javolin.jar, containing all the third
      party libraries needed for it to run. Use this version to create a
      Javolin for public release.

  testbench - Compiles Testbench and builds the Testbench.jar file.

  doc - Uses Javadoc to generate Javolin API documentation in a directory 
      called "doc".

  all - builds archive, testbench, doc.

  clean - Deletes everything created by the other commands: the build 
      directory, the doc directory, and the jar files.

---------
Libraries
---------

Javolin relies on third party libraries. If you don't have these libraries, you
cannot build or run Javolin. Most of these libraries are not checked in to the
CVS repository, so you must download them and place them into the lib directory
yourself. The following is a list of the libraries currently used, along with
URLs pointing to the download location of the version currently being developed
against. The Lib file(s) item tells you what file or files must be copied into
the lib directory so that Javolin can be compiled and run. (Please keep this
list up-to-date when new library dependencies are added to Javolin, as well as
when we move to a new version of a library that we are already using.)
