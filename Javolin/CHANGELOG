This is a high-level list of Javolin changes. For a detailed view, see the
SVN repository.

* the present

Completely rewrote the Bookkeeper class to have async APIs. (This required
me to write a batch equivalent of DiscoBackground, if that means anything
to you.) The make-table sequence is one step closer to being completely
async. The UI-selection function is all that remains; and that only blocks
on user input, not on network requests.

There is now a "File Bug Report" menu item in the "Debug" menu. It just
sends your browser to the beta bug report page.

Big menu rearrangement. Debugging items have been moved to a "Debug" menu.
Keyboard shortcuts have been rethought from scratch -- many changes. There
is a "Close Window" item.

All contextual menus on people now have a "Game Stats" item. This sends your
browser to the Volity.net page with the selected user's game standings.

Name colors (finally!) change to match the seat color.

Chat windows now let you pop up a contextual menu on (most) user messages.
The menu currently contains only a "Chat With User..." item, but we can
add more items as we think of them.

Seat panels are now tinted according to the color of the seat. (The coloring
is controlled by the UI file's metadata -- the "volity:seat-color" entry.)

UIFileCache now accepts Zip files which don't explicitly name the directories
to be created.

If you click on a Finder command link when you're disconnected (or if you
have your OS set to launch Javolin from stub files), you will now get a
connection dialog. The command will fire when you finish connecting.

The help icon (in the bottom corner of the table window) is now a button.

Added the metadata() function to the ECMAScript API.

* release 0.2.8

The Game Info window now has a tab for every resource file loaded by
the current UI.

The supported version of Smack has been upgraded. This fixes a bad 
interaction with iChat. Please get the latest version of Smack from Volity's
SVN repository or from http://volity.org/projects/javolin/buildlib/.

Javolin now reads metadata. (So does Testbench.) The Game Info dialog
displays whatever metadata is present and recognized.

* release 0.2.7

This is strictly a bugfix release. Actually, it is a jmac-screwed-up-the-
build-last-time release. He apologizes.

This release includes a game finder that works on Windows, and includes
the MP3 libraries that were supposed to be included several builds ago.

* release 0.2.6

The supported version of Batik has been upgraded to revision 379046. This
fixes a problem with <use> in an SVG 1.2 document.

The UI cache is now much better at weird cases where someone deletes files
or directories by hand. There is now a "clear interface cache" menu item.
The cache now tries to send headers which will punch through overly-smart
web proxies. Also, it does a HEAD request when comparing file modification
times.

The table window now shows dynamic help in the bottom right corner. You
can hide this panel from the "Game" tab of the Preferences.

The Game Finder's User-Agent will now be set to a Javolin version number
followed by a Java version number. E.g.: "Javolin/0.2.5 Java/1.4.2_09"

If the game finder manages to generate bad XHTML, the Finder window will
show a tidy error instead of crashing and closing. This error page contains
a link to the bug-report form.

Bots and referees now get distinct icons in the seating chart. I also made
the "ready" checkmark a distinct icon; it's no longer superimposed on the
player icon.

Contextual menus for players in the seating chart. You can chat with them, 
sit them down, stand them up.

* release 0.2.5

More nasty memory leaks found, and subsequently plugged.

* release 0.2.4

The ugly running-out-of-memory bug that afflicted Javolin is now -- I
hope -- fixed.

You can now set a system property "org.volity.bookkeeper" to choose a
bookkeeper to talk to. That is to say:
    java -Dorg.volity.bookkeeper=foo@volity.net -ea -jar Javolin.jar

The Invitation window (when you get one, not when you send one) is now
a free-floating window. It appears in the Window menu, too.

Lots of different alert noises. And preferences to silence them.

Javolin now starts up with the Finder window open, *unless* you closed the
Finder before shutting down last time. Yes, the Finder is slow. Sorry.

All referee RPCs are now async. This should improve the responsiveness
of the client -- it won't freeze up when you push the "ready" or "seat"
buttons.

MUC and table window chat logs will now show "<nick> has joined/left the
chat" messages.

Possibly fixed bugs with chat messages failing to appear, or appearing
twice.

Regularized the Join MUC process, and made it produce much nicer error
messages.

All dialog boxes that ask you for a JID now accept a simple name ("zarf")
instead of a JID ("zarf@volity.net"). You could also type "devchat" into
the Join MUC dialog instead of "devchat@conference.volity.net".

Added a "Suspend Table" menu item.

* release 0.2.3

The Finder window will launch any URLs that don't start with
"http://{www.}volity.net/gamefinder" to the user's external browser.
Launching URLs may now work on Windows, too, although I haven't tested it.
(URLs can be launched from the About window, the Finder, or any UI SVG
code that has a hyperlink.)

The seatmark() UI function works. A UI can place a mark on any (or all)
seats, to indicate whose turn it is (or whatever).

Your name is marked in the seating display (by a black dot). Your current
seat is also marked (by having the seat name in the same highlight color
as your name).

The UI can read info.version to determine what UI functions and fields are
available. (Current version is 3.)

* release 0.2.2

Changelog begins.
