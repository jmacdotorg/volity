This is a high-level list of Gamut changes. For a detailed view, see the
SVN repository.

* the present

The squashed-input-pane on Win/Linux is fixed! Only now, the input pane
on Mac defaults to two lines high. I declare this to be okay.

Cmd-I is now "Game Info". And there's a "Request Bot" button in the game
window.

* release 0.3.7

Added a "nicknames" field to the Seat object you get in the ECMAScript
UI. So you can do info.gameseats[0].nicknames. (This puts us at ECMAScript 
API 3.2.)

Added a "Request Bot From..." menu option, for when the bookkeeper doesn't
know about your bot.

Gamut now supports the new bot and bot factory API. If a parlor supplies
a list of bots, Gamut will let you choose one; if the parlor supplies bot
factories, the client will query them and display the bots they have
available. If no bots are available, the "invite bot" menu option will
be greyed out. Old-style parlors will get the old-style behavior (a single
"invite bot" menu option, whether they offer bots or not).

Added a "Remember password" option to connect dialog box.

* release 0.3.6

Draft of code to launch a browser on Unix platforms.

Display bots on your roster with a green Bot icon; you can also now invite
them to games. (This is only relevant for ronin bots.) Also fixed a bug
where if a parlor had bots running, it could show the wrong roster icon.

Added nice icons for the two Finder buttons. Also changed the name of
the first button to "Game List".

When run as part of a Mac app bundle, Gamut will now receive volity: URL
events. (Does not work if you run Gamut as a plain JAR file!)

Better error reporting if the user fails to authenticate with Jabber.

If you start Gamut with "--url volity:..." in the command-line arguments,
the command will be executed. (See the wiki for the command forms; there
are create-table, join-table, and join-lobby commands currently.) If Gamut
is already running, the Gamut you execute will transmit the command to
the existing process (and then shut down).

Made scroll-wheel scrolling in the game finder (and help menu) work at a 
reasonable rate.

Added a preference for whether the game finder always opens on startup,
never opens on startup, or whether it remembers whether you had it open
last time (the original behavior). The default for this preference is
"remember" on Mac, "always" on Windows, "always" on Linux.

* release 0.3.5

Added a "Playing This Game" menu item, which goes to a game-specified page
(via the Finder).

Added a "Gamut Help" menu item (under the Help menu, which is new for 
non-Windows users). This goes to:
<http://volity.net/games/gamut/help/welcome.html>.

Upgraded to R6-pre1 of Flying Saucer (the XHTML widget). There is a
small code change involved with this, so you must download that
version of FS in order to build Volity. The ReadMe_Build file has been
updated to reflect this.

Added support for URLs using the "volity:" scheme in the Finder, and
also in game UI SVG.  These can cause your client to create a new
table, join an existing table, or join a lobby (MUC).

Suppressed the Batik defaults of panning the SVG pane when the user types
arrow keys (and zooming on ctrl-I/ctrl-O, etc.)

Implemented the info.ruleset field, which returns the game's ruleset URI.
(This will be helpful for UIs that support several rulesets.) In Testbench,
info.ruleset will find the first volity:ruleset line in the UI's metadata.

Changed the way (private) chat messages are sent. Gamut now tries to remember
the last resource that sent you a message, and sends replies back to that
resource.

Added a "Forgot your password?" button to the Connect dialog.

Fixed a bug in resizing the Finder window on Windows.

* release 0.3.4

This release actually has no code changes; it addresses an issue
specific to the Mac OS X version, where textflow paragraphs would flow
*up* instead of down when Gamut is run with Apple's latest Java
release. A change we've made to the Mac bundle's Info.plist file runs
Gamut with an older Java instead. We're currently investigating a
cleaner fix to this problem.

* release 0.3.3

The Finder window now polls the web page periodically (every 30 seconds) to
see if it has changed.

Andrew Plotkin's new "blue-and-green V" icon debuts with this
release. It is based on the Volity Games "playing card" logo designed
by Rob Oliver, now evident at <http://volity.net>.

* release 0.3.2

Starting with this release, this application is now called Volity
Gamut. (It remains "Javolin" in earlier release notes.)

Several improvements to the MUC window. You no longer get redundant "player
has joined" messages if someone's client sends multiple presence packets.
Names in the user list no longer wrap if the panel is too narrow; also,
you can drag them (as per the usual JID drag-drop mechanisms.)

URLs in chat windows are now recognized, colored blue, underlined, and if
you click on one it's sent to your web brower. (Should this be a preference?)

If you register a new volity.net account, Gamut now updates your name
and email address in the Volity database, by sending a VCard. Also reworded
the connect dialog help text.

* release 0.3.1

All dialog boxes now have alerts like "You must enter a user name" if you
leave an important field blank.

Finder window has "Top" and "Reload" buttons.

Added a "Stats" button in the roster window titlebar.

The roster context menu is now consistent with the other popup menus. (The
code has been moved out to a RosterContextMenu class.)

You can drag any user into a table's seating panel; this pops up an invitation
dialog. (Unless he's already sitting at the table, in which case it counts
as a reseating request instead. This is surprising in some strange cases, but
I don't plan to worry about it.)

The invitation system has been seriously reworked. Invitations can now be
sent out in Jabber message packets, which means that (1) the message can
go to any client, and (2) the invitation will show up as plain text if you're
not using a Volity-aware client. This means that the whole "add user to your
roster before you invite him" aberration is gone. You can invite anybody.
(Although if someone is on your roster, inviting him will work *better* in
some ways.)

User context menus now have an "Invite to Game" submenu, listing the games
you're currently in. (The roster window menu doesn't have this yet, but I'll
get to it.)

User context menus now have an "Add to Roster..." item. (Dimmed if the person
is on your roster already.)

* release 0.3.0

Games that take an arbitrary number of players (Fluxx, etc) now display
a nameless empty seat panel. (If there are indeed any empty hidden seats.)
This panel is just a drag target; if you sit in it, you get a real seat.

For games that use resources (currently Aquarius), "Select New Resource"
has been added to the Game menu.

"Select New Interface" is now a menu option under the Game menu. It lets
you choose a new interface for the game you're playing, either from the 
bookkeeper list, from a disk file, or by typing in a URL. Also added
"Restart Interface" under the Debug menu, and made "Reload Interface"
reload the UI from the original source. ("Restart" does what "Reload" used
to do. Got it?)

The UI-selection interface is completely rewritten. It will mostly work like
it used to, but you have preference options if you want to see an explicit
"choose a UI" dialog box more often.

Your seat mark now also appears in the window title bar. (After the game
name.) This makes it easier to see when it's your turn in Windows, if you 
have the window iconified. (Would like to do something similar in the OSX
Dock, but I don't know how.)

Completely rewrote the Bookkeeper class to have async APIs. (This required
me to write a batch equivalent of DiscoBackground, if that means anything
to you.) The make-table sequence is one step closer to being completely
async. The UI-selection function is all that remains; and that only blocks
on user input, not on network requests.

There is now a "File Bug Report" menu item in the "Debug" menu. It just
sends your browser to the beta bug report page.

Big menu rearrangement. Debugging items have been moved to a "Debug" menu.
Keyboard shortcuts have been rethought from scratch -- many changes. There
is a "Close Window" item.

All contextual menus on people now have a "Game Stats" item. This sends your
browser to the Volity.net page with the selected user's game standings.

Name colors (finally!) change to match the seat color.

Chat windows now let you pop up a contextual menu on (most) user messages.
The menu currently contains only a "Chat With User..." item, but we can
add more items as we think of them.

Seat panels are now tinted according to the color of the seat. (The coloring
is controlled by the UI file's metadata -- the "volity:seat-color" entry.)

UIFileCache now accepts Zip files which don't explicitly name the directories
to be created.

If you click on a Finder command link when you're disconnected (or if you
have your OS set to launch Javolin from stub files), you will now get a
connection dialog. The command will fire when you finish connecting.

The help icon (in the bottom corner of the table window) is now a button.

Added the metadata() function to the ECMAScript API.

* release 0.2.8

The Game Info window now has a tab for every resource file loaded by
the current UI.

The supported version of Smack has been upgraded. This fixes a bad 
interaction with iChat. Please get the latest version of Smack from Volity's
SVN repository or from http://volity.org/projects/javolin/buildlib/.

Javolin now reads metadata. (So does Testbench.) The Game Info dialog
displays whatever metadata is present and recognized.

* release 0.2.7

This is strictly a bugfix release. Actually, it is a jmac-screwed-up-the-
build-last-time release. He apologizes.

This release includes a game finder that works on Windows, and includes
the MP3 libraries that were supposed to be included several builds ago.

* release 0.2.6

The supported version of Batik has been upgraded to revision 379046. This
fixes a problem with <use> in an SVG 1.2 document.

The UI cache is now much better at weird cases where someone deletes files
or directories by hand. There is now a "clear interface cache" menu item.
The cache now tries to send headers which will punch through overly-smart
web proxies. Also, it does a HEAD request when comparing file modification
times.

The table window now shows dynamic help in the bottom right corner. You
can hide this panel from the "Game" tab of the Preferences.

The Game Finder's User-Agent will now be set to a Javolin version number
followed by a Java version number. E.g.: "Javolin/0.2.5 Java/1.4.2_09"

If the game finder manages to generate bad XHTML, the Finder window will
show a tidy error instead of crashing and closing. This error page contains
a link to the bug-report form.

Bots and referees now get distinct icons in the seating chart. I also made
the "ready" checkmark a distinct icon; it's no longer superimposed on the
player icon.

Contextual menus for players in the seating chart. You can chat with them, 
sit them down, stand them up.

* release 0.2.5

More nasty memory leaks found, and subsequently plugged.

* release 0.2.4

The ugly running-out-of-memory bug that afflicted Javolin is now -- I
hope -- fixed.

You can now set a system property "org.volity.bookkeeper" to choose a
bookkeeper to talk to. That is to say:
    java -Dorg.volity.bookkeeper=foo@volity.net -ea -jar Javolin.jar

The Invitation window (when you get one, not when you send one) is now
a free-floating window. It appears in the Window menu, too.

Lots of different alert noises. And preferences to silence them.

Javolin now starts up with the Finder window open, *unless* you closed the
Finder before shutting down last time. Yes, the Finder is slow. Sorry.

All referee RPCs are now async. This should improve the responsiveness
of the client -- it won't freeze up when you push the "ready" or "seat"
buttons.

MUC and table window chat logs will now show "<nick> has joined/left the
chat" messages.

Possibly fixed bugs with chat messages failing to appear, or appearing
twice.

Regularized the Join MUC process, and made it produce much nicer error
messages.

All dialog boxes that ask you for a JID now accept a simple name ("zarf")
instead of a JID ("zarf@volity.net"). You could also type "devchat" into
the Join MUC dialog instead of "devchat@conference.volity.net".

Added a "Suspend Table" menu item.

* release 0.2.3

The Finder window will launch any URLs that don't start with
"http://{www.}volity.net/gamefinder" to the user's external browser.
Launching URLs may now work on Windows, too, although I haven't tested it.
(URLs can be launched from the About window, the Finder, or any UI SVG
code that has a hyperlink.)

The seatmark() UI function works. A UI can place a mark on any (or all)
seats, to indicate whose turn it is (or whatever).

Your name is marked in the seating display (by a black dot). Your current
seat is also marked (by having the seat name in the same highlight color
as your name).

The UI can read info.version to determine what UI functions and fields are
available. (Current version is 3.)

* release 0.2.2

Changelog begins.
