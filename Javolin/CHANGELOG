CVS repository.

* the present

Added a "Suspend Table" menu item.

* release 0.2.3

The Finder window will launch any URLs that don't start with
"http://{www.}volity.net/gamefinder" to the user's external browser.
Launching URLs may now work on Windows, too, although I haven't tested it.
(URLs can be launched from the About window, the Finder, or any UI SVG
code that has a hyperlink.)

The seatmark() UI function works. A UI can place a mark on any (or all)
seats, to indicate whose turn it is (or whatever).

Your name is marked in the seating display (by a black dot). Your current
seat is also marked (by having the seat name in the same highlight color
as your name).

The UI can read info.version to determine what UI functions and fields are
available. (Current version is 3.)

* release 0.2.2

Changelog begins.
