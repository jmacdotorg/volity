* the present

The seatmark() UI function works. A UI can place a mark on any (or all)
seats, to indicate whose turn it is (or whatever).

Your name is marked in the seating display (by a black dot). Your current
seat is also marked (by having the seat name in the same highlight color
as your name).

The UI can read info.version to determine what UI functions and fields are
available. (Current version is 3.)

* release 0.2.2

Changelog begins.
