This is a high-level list of Javolin changes. For a detailed view, see the
CVS repository.

* release 0.2.5

More nasty memory leaks found, and subsequently plugged.

* release 0.2.4

The ugly running-out-of-memory bug that afflicted Javolin is now -- I
hope -- fixed.

You can now set a system property "org.volity.bookkeeper" to choose a
bookkeeper to talk to. That is to say:
    java -Dorg.volity.bookkeeper=foo@volity.net -ea -jar Javolin.jar

The Invitation window (when you get one, not when you send one) is now
a free-floating window. It appears in the Window menu, too.

Lots of different alert noises. And preferences to silence them.

Javolin now starts up with the Finder window open, *unless* you closed the
Finder before shutting down last time. Yes, the Finder is slow. Sorry.

All referee RPCs are now async. This should improve the responsiveness
of the client -- it won't freeze up when you push the "ready" or "seat"
buttons.

MUC and table window chat logs will now show "<nick> has joined/left the
chat" messages.

Possibly fixed bugs with chat messages failing to appear, or appearing
twice.

Regularized the Join MUC process, and made it produce much nicer error
messages.

All dialog boxes that ask you for a JID now accept a simple name ("zarf")
instead of a JID ("zarf@volity.net"). You could also type "devchat" into
the Join MUC dialog instead of "devchat@conference.volity.net".

Added a "Suspend Table" menu item.

* release 0.2.3

The Finder window will launch any URLs that don't start with
"http://{www.}volity.net/gamefinder" to the user's external browser.
Launching URLs may now work on Windows, too, although I haven't tested it.
(URLs can be launched from the About window, the Finder, or any UI SVG
code that has a hyperlink.)

The seatmark() UI function works. A UI can place a mark on any (or all)
seats, to indicate whose turn it is (or whatever).

Your name is marked in the seating display (by a black dot). Your current
seat is also marked (by having the seat name in the same highlight color
as your name).

The UI can read info.version to determine what UI functions and fields are
available. (Current version is 3.)

* release 0.2.2

Changelog begins.
