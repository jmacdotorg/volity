Smack 2.0.0 (Volity)

This is a modification of the Smack XMPP library, version 2.0. It did
not branch off exactly from the Smack 2.0.0 release; it began slightly
later, with the Smack trunk as of 2005-09-25, and therefore has some
bug fixes that Smack 2.0.0 lacks.

The latest version of Smack 2.0.0 (Volity) can be found at Volity's
Sourceforge repository:

    http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=91751

The original Smack library is available from:

    http://www.jivesoftware.org/smack/

------------------------

The intent of these modifications are to make Smack more extensible
and customizable. There are two basic kinds of changes:

* Change the "private" fields of library standard classes to
"protected", so that these classes can be usefully extended.
* Turn hardwired class instantiations into factory functions, so that
a user can make use of extended classes in place of library-standard
ones.

I am not (currently) trying to make these kinds of changes across the
whole of Smack. The Volity project has specific needs, and I'm working
on those. However, I think these kinds of changes are valuable for
Smack developers. I hope they are incorporated into the main
development stream, and the general principles adopted.

Changelog:

(I'm not using release numbers, because "Smack 2.0.0.V.7" will make
your eyes bleed. I will mark SVN revision numbers as major changes go in
listed below, most-recent-first.)

* discobug (revision 859)
    Fixed a bug with disco#info error responses. This was causing iChat
to flail wildly.

* (prior to this point, source was in CVS, so no SVN revision numbers are
available)

* disco
    Added service discovery extension forms (JEP-0128) to 
ServiceDiscoveryManager.
    Added a ServiceDiscoveryFactory API to ServiceDiscoveryManager, in case
you want your connections to use a subclass of SDM.

* packethack
    XMPPConnection's creation of its packetReader and packetWriter have
been broken out into a separate, protected method called
initPacketReaderAndWriter. (Analogous to initReaderAndWriter.)
This allows a subclass to create different ones. This is an extreme way
of making the XMPPConnection do what you want, but it's available if
you need it.

* presence
    All presence packets are now drawn from a factory API inside 
XMPPConnection. The user can set a new factory, or subclass XMPPConnection
and have it set its own.

* protected
    Changed "private" fields and methods to "protected". This covers most
of smack, and the disco/MUC features of smackx.

* original
    Identical with the 2005-09-25 nightly build.
