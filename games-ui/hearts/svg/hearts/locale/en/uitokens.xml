		<value>This is a standard variant of hearts.  Hearts are worth === 1 point, the Queen of Spades is worth 13.  Hearts can't === be played until they've been broken; the queen doesn't === count as a heart.  No points can be laid in the first === trick of a hand. Shooting the moon requires taking all === point cards, and always increases your opponents' === scores by 26 points.</value>
