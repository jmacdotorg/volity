This directory contains UI files for several Volity games. Most of these
games are implemented (that is, their parlors are implemented) in the
games-perl/ or games-python/ directories. A couple of the UIs are solely
intended to test client features, and do not correspond with any existing
parlor code.

As with all Volity game UI files, their principal language is
ECMAScript (JavaScript), but they are intended for different "target"
clients, such as text-only or SVG. (The SVG client is much more complete
than the text client, to date, so most of these UIs are SVG.)

In some cases, support files (such as bitmapped images or sound files)
are included along with the code.
