This CVS module contails UI files for several Volity games. Generally,
they're the same games whose server-side implementations (in Perl) can
be found in the games-perl CVS module.

As with all Volity game UI files, their principal language is
ECMAScript (JavaScript), but they may be intended for different
"target" clients, such as text-only or SVG.

In some cases, support files (such as bitmapped images) are included
along with the code.
