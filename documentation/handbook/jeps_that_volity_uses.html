<hr class=wikilineheader></div><div class=wikitext>Jabber uses an RFC-like system to document suggested extensions to the core XMPP protocol. Each of these documents is called a Jabber Enhancement Proposal, or a JEP, and is identifiable by a unique serial number (in the form "JEP-<em>NNNN</em>"). As with RFCs, JEPs keep their tenuous-sounding name even after they are recognized as official protocol extensions by the Jabber Council.

Here are the JEPs that can be found in use by Volity:

<UL >
<li> <a href="/web/20070301123652/http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0004.html">[JEP-0004: Data Forms]</a> Used when the server needs to send configuration information, a bot menu, or the like to a client.
<li> <a href="/web/20070301123652/http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0009.html">[JEP-0009: Jabber-RPC]</a> Used for high-level, game-specific communication between <a href="gameserver.html" class=wikipagelink>GameServer</a>s and <a href="clientapplication.html" class=wikipagelink>ClientApplication</a>s.
<li> <a href="/web/20070301123652/http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0030.html">[JEP-0030: Service Discovery]</a> Used for the Volity <a href="gamebrowser.html" class=wikipagelink>GameBrowser</a>, the <a href="ui_finder.html" class=wikipagelink>UI finder</a>, and other services. See also <a href="servicediscovery.html" class=wikipagelink>ServiceDiscovery</a>.
<li> <a href="/web/20070301123652/http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0045.html?PHPSESSID=04bce254492064440b791de13937c66b">[JEP-0045: Multi-User Chat]</a> The basis of Volity <a href="gametable.html" class=wikipagelink>GameTable</a>s.
<li> <a href="/web/20070301123652/http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0078.html">[JEP-0078: Non-SASL Authentication]</a> This is the de facto standard for Jabber authentication (jabber:iq:auth), but it isn't included in the IETF standard drafts for various reasons.  Pretty much every current Jabber library already supports this, both on the client and server side, but I'm listing it here for completeness.  Volity implementations probably won't be supporting SASL any time soon.  --dougo
<li> <a href="/web/20070301123652/http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0115.html">[JEP-0115]</a> Allows a Volity entity to identify itself in its presence stanzas. See <a href="entity_capabilities.html" class=wikipagelink>Entity Capabilities</a>.
<li> <a href="/web/20070301123652/http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0128.html">[JEP-0128]</a> Allows data forms to exist within service-discovery responses, allowing Volity entities to reveal a wide variety of information about  themselves when browsed via disco.
