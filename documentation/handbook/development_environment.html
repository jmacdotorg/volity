<hr class=wikilineheader></div><div class=wikitext>Volity is designed to give you lots in freedom in what you make and how you make it, but by the same token it can be awfully confusing for a newcomer to know where to start. This page describes the <strong>development environment</strong> that we recommend for Volity game programmers.
<p>
<H2>What you need to have</H2>

<p>
<UL >
<li> Your favorite text editor (or editors), for all the code you'll be dealing with. 
<UL >
<li> You'll be working with the following sorts of files:
<UL >
<li> Perl or Python code
<li> XML (SVG, to be specific)
<li> ECMAScript (a.k.a. <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?JavaScript" class=wikipagelink>JavaScript</a>)
</UL>
<li> We at the Volity project like and recommend <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/CategoryPorts">[Emacs]</a> as an all-purpose text editor.
<UL >
<li> It comes with Perl and Java editing modes, the latter of which works great with ECMAScript.
<li> You can download and install <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://www.thaiopensource.com/nxml-mode/">[nXML-mode]</a>, a lightweight XML-editing mode that we like.
<li> An <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://sourceforge.net/projects/python-mode/">[Emacs mode for Python]</a> is also available.
</UL>
</UL>
<li> <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?Gamut" class=wikipagelink>Gamut</a>, for connecting to the Volity network as a game player -- eventually you'll use this to play your own game!
<li> <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?Testbench" class=wikipagelink>Testbench</a>, for offline development of your game's <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?UI_File" class=wikipagelink>UI file</a>
<UL >
<li> Not required, but useful, is the Squiggle graphical viewer (with DOM viewing support, which is handy for debugging).  This is a part of <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/svgviewer.html">[Batik]</a>.
</UL>
<li> Software to develop your game module and run it as a parlor. Your choices include:
<UL >
<li> <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?Frivolity" class=wikipagelink>Frivolity</a>, if you like Perl, or
<li> <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://www.eblong.com/zarf/volity/index.html">[Zarf's Python stuff]</a>, if you prefer Python.
</UL>
</UL>
<p>
<H2>What you need to know</H2>

<p>
<UL >
<li> Either the Perl or Python programming language, so that you can use one of the existing parlor frameworks.
<UL >
<li> You could also set out to create your own framework in another language that you like more than these. But as this would involve implementing the entire <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?Parlor" class=wikipagelink>parlor</a> and <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?Referee" class=wikipagelink>referee</a> protocols, it might be easier to program in Perl or Python instead.
</UL>
<li> Basic principles of <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?SVG" class=wikipagelink>SVG</a>. This is probably the trickiest part, since SVG is a relatively new technology, and there's not a ton of good reference material on it. We recommend:
<UL >
<li> <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/svgess/index.html">[SVG Essentials by J. David Eisenberg]</a>, published by O'Reilly Media. This is a great primer of all things SVG, and what <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?Jmac" class=wikipagelink>Jmac</a> read before starting to design Volity as we know it today. It includes a summary of scripting SVG with ECMAScript, which is key to creating Volity UI files.
</UL>
<li> Working knowledge of <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?ECMAScript" class=wikipagelink>ECMAScript</a>.
<li> An understanding of the DOM<a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?action=edit&id=DOM" class=wikipageedit>?</a>, and how you can use ECMAScript to manipulate SVG.
<UL >
<li> Some web pages that have basics detailing the interaction between SVG and ECMAScript include <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://www.carto.net/papers/svg/manipulating_svg_with_dom_ecmascript/">[carto:net's Manipulating SVG Documents Using ECMAScript]</a> and <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://www.learnsvg.com/html/bitmap/chapter10/page10-1.htm">[Chapter 10 of Learn SVG]</a>.
