<h1>Volity.Net</h1><div class=wikitext><H2>The volity.net website</H2>

<p>
The website running at <code>http://volity.net</code> is going to serve several purposes:
<UL >
<li> The enduser-friendly Web front-end to the public Volity network, and an introduction into the world of Volity.
<li> A place for Volity players to look up game histories, browse player stats, and maintain their personal records.
<li> Game developers' interface to the volity.net bookkeeper, giving them an opportunity to register and maintain their parlors, UI files, and rulesets.
</UL>
<p>
As of March 2006 it's under rapid development, mostly by <a href="http://volity.net/history/index.html">[You can visit its current introductory page]</a> and log in with your volity.net ID. (If you don't have a volity.net ID, you can create one with Gamut.)
<p>
<H2>The volity.net Jabber server</H2>

<p>
There is also a Jabber server running at <code>volity.net</code>, maintained by <a href="andy_turner.html" class=wikipagelink>Andy Turner</a>. It hosts all of Volity's <a href="jabber_entity.html" class=wikipagelink>Jabber entities</a> that the core Volity team runs, such as the <a href="bookkeeper.html" class=wikipagelink>bookkeeper</a> and the <a href="test_servers.html" class=wikipagelink>test servers</a>. 
<p>
Since it allows open user regsitration, any user can create Jabber accounts there, which can be applied to Volity <a href="player.html" class=wikipagelink>player</a>s, <a href="ronin.html" class=wikipagelink>ronin</a>, or <a href="parlor.html" class=wikipagelink>parlor</a>s. Thus, much of "jid.html" class=wikipagelink>JID</a>s that have <code>volity.net</code> as their host part, but they don't receive any special role or precedence on the network compared to entities connecting from other domains' Jabber servers.
