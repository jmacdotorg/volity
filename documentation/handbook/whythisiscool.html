<h1>WhyThisIsCool</h1><div class=wikitext>This page will hold a list of PR-appropriate reasons why the MIGS/Volity<a href="action=edit&id=whythisiscool/volity.html" class=wikipageedit>?</a> game system is cool and unique. Please add to it as you think of things.
<p>
Update, 12/29/2003: I've added something like is as a section to the <a href="volitybook.html" class=wikipagelink>VolityBook</a>.
<p>
<H2>User-level reasons (a.k.a. Player-level reasons)</H2>

<p>
<UL >
<li> Download a single client application for your computer, and you can play all MIGS games! (Compliant ones, anyway.)
</UL>
<p>
<UL >
<li> Massively multiplatform, since the servers do all the work. Use a Web-based client if all else fails.
</UL>
<p>
<UL >
<li> i18n and l9n support (with game servers that support localized strings &amp; such)
</UL>
<p>
<H2>Game-designer (module-writer) reasons</H2>

<p>
<UL >
<li> Game module authors won't have to themselves run or even have access to a Jabber server in order to run a Volity game server, since a game server can run as a simple user of any existing Jabber server with which the author can acquire a Jabber login. Resource leveraging is cool.
</UL>
<p>
<UL >
<li> You can make computer games without worrying about user management, user communication, state-saving, or network protocols. or creating client applications. A lot of UI work is done for you, but you still need to design a game-specific UI.
</UL>
