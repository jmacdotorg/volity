<h1>Game Developer's Overview</h1><div class=wikitext>So you have a game, and you want to implement it in Volity. 
<p>
This is an (extremely high-level) overview of what you need to do:
<p>
<UL >
<li> Write a <a href="ruleset.html" class=wikipagelink>ruleset</a> document, which will define the game-specific API that the referee and UI file will need to use.
<li> Write a game module, which will act as a <a href="referee.html" class=wikipagelink>referee</a>.
<li> Write a <a href="ui_file.html" class=wikipagelink>UI file</a>.
<li> Once those are written, publish the <a href="ui_file.html" class=wikipagelink>UI file</a>, and run a <a href="parlor.html" class=wikipagelink>parlor</a> that executes the game module.
<li> Finally, register your parlor with the <a href="volity.net.html" class=wikipagelink>volity.net</a> bookkeeper.
</UL>
<p>
<H2>What you need</H2>

<p>
See the page about the <a href="development_environment.html" class=wikipagelink>development environment</a> we recommend.
<p>
<H2>The game module</H2>

<p>
The game module is the "referee.html" class=wikipagelink>referee</a>. The referee manages a <a href="table.html" class=wikipagelink>table</a>; the game module is in charge of the game which gets played there.
<p>
You currently have two choices for writing a game module: Perl, and Python. For each language, there is a library which implements the Volity <a href="parlor.html" class=wikipagelink>parlor</a> and <a href="referee.html" class=wikipagelink>referee</a>. 
<p>
There is also a "Game" class. (In Python, this is <code>volity.game.Game</code>; in Perl, it is <code>Volity::Game</code>.) Your actual task is to write a subclass of this class.
<p>
Right now, you have two language options for game module creation. Both include extensive documentation and examples.
<p>
<H3>Perl</H3>

<p>
<a href="jmac.html" class=wikipagelink>Jmac</a> maintains <a href="frivolity.html" class=wikipagelink>Frivolity</a>, a set of libraries and programs that allow you to create and run parlors in Perl. The package includes a complete, working example of a Tic Tac Toe parlor, including sample UI and ruleset files (even though those aren't part of the game module creation process).
<p>
<H3>Python</H3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.eblong.com/zarf/volity/index.html">[the Volity page of Zarf's website]</a>.
<p>
<p>
<H2>The UI file</H2>

<p>
The UI file is, as the name implies, the user interface. It is displayed in a <a href="client.html" class=wikipagelink>client</a> window. Whenever the <a href="referee.html" class=wikipagelink>referee</a> announces a move, the UI updates itself to display the new game state. Whenever a player needs to make a move, the UI watches for his mouse-clicks and reports them to the <a href="referee.html" class=wikipagelink>referee</a>.
<p>
You currently have just one choice for writing a UI file: <a href="svg.html" class=wikipagelink>SVG</a>, with embedded <a href="ecmascript.html" class=wikipagelink>ECMAScript</a>. (That's the same as Javascript, really.)
<p>
The embedded script code can call various functions to get stuff done: see the <a href="ecmascript_api.html" class=wikipagelink>ECMAScript API</a>.
<p>
A <a href="http://volity.org/docs/ui-guide/ui-guide-html/guide.html">[thorough introduction and example]</a> is in the <a href="http://volity.org/docs/">[developer documentation]</a>.
<p>
See also: <a href="svg_tricks.html" class=wikipagelink>SVG tricks</a> and <a href="svg_script_tricks.html" class=wikipagelink>SVG script tricks</a>.
<p>
<em>Jmac wishes me to note that there is actually a second choice: plain text with embedded ECMAScript. This is the <a href="friv.html" class=wikipagelink>Friv</a> client. It exists purely as a protocol example right now -- it's horribly unfriendly and no player will want to use it. So you can ignore it.</em>
