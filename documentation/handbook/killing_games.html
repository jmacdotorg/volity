<h1>Killing Games</h1><div class=wikitext>If players get tired of a game in mid-play, and want to abandon it, the easiest course is for them all to simply quit their Volity clients. (The referee will mark the game as <a href="referee_states.html" class=wikipagelink>abandoned</a>, and eventually suspend it, and then destroy it entirely if nobody is present at the table.)
<p>
However, the players may want to kill the game in order to restart it. It should be convenient to do this without leaving the table or creating a new table.
<p>
Therefore, the referee accepts a volity.kill_game(boolean) <a href="rpc_requests.html" class=wikipagelink>RPC</a>. This is effectively a game configuration request which can only be used when the game is <a href="referee_states.html" class=wikipagelink>suspended</a>. If this is set <code>true</code>, then when the game unsuspends, it will immediately terminate. The referee will then cycle back to the <a href="referee_states.html" class=wikipagelink>setup</a> state.
<p>
From the players' point of view, killing a game works like this:
<p>
<UL >
<li> Some seated player sends volity.suspend_game(). The game is now suspended.
<li> Someone sends volity.kill_game(true). This is a config change, so all players are now unready.
<li> All seated players send volity.ready().
<li> The referee terminates the game and returns to the setup phase.
</UL>
