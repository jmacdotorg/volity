<p>
This website is a <em>Wiki</em>, which means that every page is editable by anyone, by way of the "Edit this page" links. Everyone can also use the <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?RecentChanges" class=wikipagelink>RecentChanges</a> page to see which Wiki pages have recently been edited, and use any page's "diff" and "View other revisions" links to see the details of any change (and revert them to earlier versions if necessary); in this way, we get to exert some measure of quality control as well.
<p>
Wikis use their own, very simple markup language that's meant to be easier than HTML. The <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?TextFormattingRules">[Usemod editing guide]</a> is an excellent resource for learning Wiki markup, especially since the Volity website happens to run on a copy of UseMod.
<p>
You can practice editing by visiting the <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?Sandbox" class=wikipagelink>sandbox</a> and changing that page as much as you'd like. (However, you must first prove that you are an interested human and not a slimy spammer by plugging a password into a special page on this Wiki, <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://www.volity.org/wiki_info.html">[as outlined here]</a>. You'll only have to do this once.)
<p>
Once you get the hang of it, feel free to contribute to the rest of the site. Also consider making a page about yourself, and linking it to the <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?Volity_People" class=wikipagelink>volity people</a> page.
<p>
<H2>Volity Wiki Style</H2>

<p>
We've been loosely adhering to the <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide">[Wikipedia style guide]</a> when making edits, because it's an easy-to-remember ruleset that results in clean-looking and meaningful pages.
<p>
<H3>Headers and introductions</H3>

<p>
In-pages headers should begin at level two (using the <code>== Two Equal-Signs ==</code> notation), and proceed from there.
<p>
In "encyclopedic" pages that set out to define a single topic, the first instance of the page's topic/title should appear in <strong>bold</strong>. For example, in a page that defined "Foobar" and that has the title "Foobar", the first paragraph might begin <em>A <strong>foobar</strong> is a device used to calibrate widgets</em>.
<p>
<H3>Making links</H3>

<p>
This site tends to avoid "CamelCase" links, preferering to use UseMod's double-bracket notation to create freeform links that allow single words, or phrases with space characters. In order words, if you want to create a link to a page titled "Foo bar", you'd create the link by typing <code>[[foo bar]]</code>, not <code>FooBar</code>. Note that these links are not case-sensitive.
<p>
You can still use CamelCase if you'd like, but <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?Jmac" class=wikipagelink>Jmac</a> reserves the right to rename and redirect your page as his leisure. :)
<p>
<H3>Redirections</H3>

<p>
To redirect one page to another, give it one line of text which says
<p>
<PRE >
  #REDIRECT Destination
</PRE>
<p>
Don't set up chains of redirects -- they stop working after one hop. A redirect should always point at a real page.
