<H2>Henry, Austin</H2>

<p>
I'm presently implementing a hearts game.  Every gaming site needs a hearts game, right?  This is (and has been for a while) playable.  Enhancements wait in the wings, ready but not deployed.
<p>
I'm also working on an Aquarius playing bot.  We shall see if it's any good :)
<p>
On the "potential" list is a <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://diplom.org/">[diplomacy]</a> implementation.  It's partly done, but I don't know if I will ever finish it though.  If I do, it will take a good long while.

<H2>Kasper, Craig</H2>

<p>
<a href="/web/20070802131051/http://indie-volity-devblog.blogspot.com/">["The Game's Afoot"]</a> - this is a blog devoted to developing games for Volity, in order to provide both updates about new happenings and instructional material for new developers.  Please contact me at craigkas-AT-myway-DOT-com if you want the ability to post directly (as opposed to simply commenting on the blog entries).
<p>
Spoons - I am currently working slowly on an implementation of Spoons for Volity, and documenting the process on the blog above.  I am open to collaborators for this project.
<p>
Future projects - My future projects may include an adaptation of the game of Rook as I am accustomed to playing it.

<H2>Orleans, Doug</H2>

<p>
I am working on an implementation of <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://www.pair-of-dice.com/games/knockabout.html">[Knockabout]</a> with the referee in Scheme.  (Actually, in <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://download.plt-scheme.org/doc/301/html/swindle/">[Swindle]</a>, an object-oriented extension of <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://plt-scheme.org/">[PLT Scheme]</a>.)  This means I'm also working on a <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?Jabber" class=wikipagelink>Jabber</a> library in Scheme, as well as a <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://www.w3.org/DOM/DOMTR">[DOM]</a> library (I have most of DOM Level 2 Core finished).
<p>
I also have a random <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.net/games/gamefinder/ruleset.html?uri=http://volity.org/games/treehouse/">[Treehouse]</a>-playing <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?Ronin" class=wikipagelink>ronin</a> bot, written in "plain" Scheme.  I will probably be porting this to Swindle pretty soon, as part of the process of updating it to comply with the <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?Bot_API" class=wikipagelink>Bot API</a>.
<p>
Future games I might like to implement: <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/986">[Babel]</a>, <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Ginohn/games/Gnostica/GnosticaRules.html">[Gnostica]</a>, <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/559">[Metro]</a>, <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://www.wizwar.com/">[Wiz-War]</a>, <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://www.roborally.com/">[Robo Rally]</a>, <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://www.sjgames.com/inwo/">[INWO]</a>.  I have actually implemented bits and pieces of all of these before, except Gnostica.  I think there are already online implementations of Metro, Wiz-War, and Robo Rally, so I might be less interested in them once I check them out.  Or I might be more interested, if I think I can do better.

<p>
Lots of stuff, obviously. But with my Volity game-developer hat on, I am working on a Tarot deck (for use in Zarcana/Gnostica<a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?action=edit&id=CurrentProjects/Gnostica" class=wikipageedit>?</a>) and Binary Homeworlds.
