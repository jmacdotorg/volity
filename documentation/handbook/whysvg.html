 Subject: [Volity-devel] SVG pros &amp; cons?

 I was reading up on SVG a bit last night, and once again was daunted
 by the idea of making a game GUI without high-level support for things
 like buttons, menus, and windows.  SVG does seem to have a lot of neat
 things: scalability, style sheets, different scripting languages,
 etc. (one day I'd like to try scripting SVG with Scheme).  But I'm
 still a little unsure how these benefits weigh up against just
 making GUI applets in Java with Swing.  I asked Jason last night, but
 he told me to ask him again when he was more awake.  So here I am
 asking in public so he can enter his opinion into the record.  :)
 (Or if anyone else wants to chime in, feel free.)

<H3>Advantages</H3>

<p>
<OL >
<li> Doesn't require Java (Not That There Is Anything Wrong With It)
<li> Declaritive not imperative

<H3>Making Widgets Hard?</H3>

<p>
Yeah, we probably will have to make some of them ourselves.  There are already fill-in forms.  We don't expect any harder then doing so in HTML.
