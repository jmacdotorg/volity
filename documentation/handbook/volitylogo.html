<h1>VolityLogo</h1><div class=wikitext>Volity has no logo. I'd like something spiffy to replace that chess-playing dude in the corner of this Wiki. (Which I found through a quick Google Images search last summer. "Playing chess in outer space; that's pretty cool." But still.)
<p>
The closest thing we have to a logo right now is the way the word "Volity" appears on the <a href="http://volity.org/">[homepage]</a>. Zzzz...
<p>
<em>(You can add graphics to this page (or any page of the Wiki) by simply pasting image URLs into the page-editing box.)</em>
<p>
<em>(Of course, the logo should be in <a href="svg.html" class=wikipagelink>SVG</a>.)</em>

Ok, now that I've messed around with SVG for a while:
<p>
<object width='400' height='400' data="http://eblong.com/zarf/volity/pic/vollogo.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object> 
<p>
<object width='64' height='64' data="http://eblong.com/zarf/volity/pic/vollogo.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>  <object width='40' height='40' data="http://eblong.com/zarf/volity/pic/vollogo.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object> 
<p>
Here is the same thing rendered as a PNG, in case your browser doesn't do SVG:
<p>
<img src="/web/20070802131051im_/http://eblong.com/zarf/volity/pic/vollogo.png">
<p>
Note that Firefox doesn't do filters, so the background will look flat in Firefox. Actually, it isn't rendering this image at all, but I don't know if that's because of the filters or because I borked the SVG syntax. It works under Adobe's SVG plugin and under Batik, and the <a href="svg_validator.html" class=wikipagelink>SVG validator</a> isn't complaining.

I like it! I wonder if the background bumpiness is a bit much, though, and I might make the lines of the "jmac.html" class=wikipagelink>jmac</a>
<p>
I adjusted those parameters, and added a darker edge to the disk to improve visibility. I don't want the lines too bold when the image is large, though. Actually, the clever thing to do is have the line width <em>adjust</em> depending on the viewport size.... That takes scripting, and I'm not getting it to work right in all renderers. Oh well. <a href="zarf.html" class=wikipagelink>zarf</a>
