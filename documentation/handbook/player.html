<h1>Player</h1><div class=wikitext>A <strong>player</strong> is a Volity network entity who actively interacts with the network, mostly by playing <a href="game.html" class=wikipagelink>game</a>s. It can be a human connecting through a <a href="client.html" class=wikipagelink>client</a>, or a computer-controlled <a href="bot.html" class=wikipagelink>bot</a>. In either case, players earn <a href="elo_score.html" class=wikipagelink>ELO score</a>s as they play different games, and accumulate <a href="reputation_system.html" class=wikipagelink>reputation</a> as they interact with other players.
<p>
For simplicity's sake we refer to all Volity users as "table.html" class=wikipagelink>table</a>, a player might be simply <a href="game_observation.html" class=wikipagelink>observing</a>, rather that sitting in a <a href="seat.html" class=wikipagelink>seat</a> and actually playing.
<p>
Like all over Volity (and <a href="jabber.html" class=wikipagelink>Jabber</a>) entities, every player is uniquely identified by its <a href="jabberid.html" class=wikipagelink>JabberID</a>. The base part of a player's JID (that is, everything before the resource string) is used as a key for all <a href="bookkeeper.html" class=wikipagelink>bookkeeper</a>-level lookups, as with the reputation system.
