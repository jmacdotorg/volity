<h1>JabberID</h1><div class=wikitext>Every entity on a Jabber network -- and therefore, on Volity -- is uniquely identifiable by a <strong><a href="jabberid.html" class=wikipagelink>JabberID</a></strong>, or JID. A <a href="jabberid.html" class=wikipagelink>JabberID</a> takes the form
<p>
<PRE >
 NODE@HOST/RESOURCE
</PRE>
<p>
<UL >
<li> <strong>NODE</strong> is the name that distinguishes this entity from other Jabber users on the same host. You can think of it as a user name or screen name.
<li> <strong>HOST</strong> is the network name of the machine running the Jabber server that the entity is connecting from, such as <code>volity.net</code>.
<li> <strong>RESOURCE</strong> is a little tricky. When a user or other entity establishes a connection to a Jabber server, it also specifies a "resource" string that distinguishes this particular <em>connection</em> from any others that the same entity might be carrying on. So two JIDs that differ only in <em>resource</em> refer to the same entity.
</UL>
<p>
Note that the <em>node</em> and <em>resource</em> parts are optional (but Jabber entities use all three parts). 
<p>
It's important to note that all automated Volity entities that expect unsolicited communication from other users -- namely, <a href="parlor.html" class=wikipagelink>parlor</a>s and the <a href="bookkeeper.html" class=wikipagelink>bookkeeper</a> -- always have a resource string of <code>volity</code>. This allows users to contact them without having to figure out what resource to use.
<p>
<a href="referee.html" class=wikipagelink>Referee</a>s and <a href="client.html" class=wikipagelink>client</a>s generally have ugly, random-looking resource strings like <code>ref_3221_1136823991</code> or <code>JavolinBJKVWS</code>. (This allows the mechanisms behind these entities to reuse the same JID under different resource strings for separate tasks, such as parlors do when spawning off new <a href="referee.html" class=wikipagelink>referee</a>s.)
<p>
The <a href="game_record.html" class=wikipagelink>game record</a> and <a href="elo_score.html" class=wikipagelink>ELO score</a> information stored by the <a href="bookkeeper.html" class=wikipagelink>bookkeeper</a> do not include resource strings. Players are referred to only by their bare JID (NODE@HOST). This ensure that even if you play Volity games from several clients, all your games redound to your credit.
