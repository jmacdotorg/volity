<h1>Vocabulary</h1><div class=wikitext>There is a lot of Volity jargon sprinkled through the wiki, and also in the client interface, in source code, etc. We would like all of this jargon to be consistent and (preferably) not confusing.
<p>
This page tracks confusing terms. Where possible, we should change other wiki pages, UI elements, web site elements, and so on to match what's defined here.
<p>
<H3><a href="user.html" class=wikipagelink>User</a></H3>

<p>
A Volity user is anyone who has used the system.
<p>
In the context of a <a href="table.html" class=wikipagelink>table</a>, everyone present at the table (except the <a href="referee.html" class=wikipagelink>referee</a>) is a user. A user can be an <strong><a href="game_observation.html" class=wikipagelink>observer</a></strong> (standing, not taking part in the game) or a <strong>player</strong> (seated, taking part in the game).
<p>
Outside the context of a table, "player" and "user" mean the same thing. (Everyone using Volity is a game-player of some sort.) But "user" is preferable. Reserve "player" for someone who is playing a particular game at the moment.
<p>
A <a href="bot.html" class=wikipagelink>bot</a> is a user, albeit a cybernetic user.
<p>
<H3><a href="table.html" class=wikipagelink>Table</a></H3>

<p>
A Volity <a href="table.html" class=wikipagelink>table</a> is a <a href="muc.html" class=wikipagelink>MUC</a> with a <a href="referee.html" class=wikipagelink>referee</a> present.
<p>
It is possible to join a table with a plain <a href="jabber.html" class=wikipagelink>Jabber</a> client (like iChat). You will see all the users, and you can take part in table chat, but you won't see any game moves.
<p>
<H3><a href="referee.html" class=wikipagelink>Referee</a></H3>

<p>
From the player's point of view, a <a href="referee.html" class=wikipagelink>referee</a> is the Volity entity which is present at the table, which mysteriously manages the game. (You don't really see it do any of this game management, but it's doing it. )
<p>
From the developer's point of view, the referee is divided into two parts, called (confusingly) the referee object and the game object. The referee object handles all the communication and the general Volity bookkeeping. The game object handles all the game logic and the game-specific decisions.
