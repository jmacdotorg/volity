<hr class=wikilineheader></div><div class=wikitext>In general, a Volity entity should time out <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?Jabber-RPC" class=wikipagelink>Jabber-RPC</a> calls after a short interval. (30 seconds is reasonable.) This can be implemented in the low-level Jabber communication code, so it applies to every RPC call.
<p>
Timeout errors can be handled the same way as stanza errors or RPC faults. Most code that sends an RPC call does not care about the result, anyway.

<strong>Original text of this page:</strong>
<p>
What is the policy on timeouts on <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?Jabber-RPC" class=wikipagelink>Jabber-RPC</a> calls?
<p>
A distributed system (fancy word) will usually have some notion that if you send an RPC, and N seconds go by, the system assumes that the other end -- or the network in between -- is hung or dead. You "receive" an error reply back (actually generated on your end, of course).
<p>
We have the Jabber server watching over us; we'll get presence notification if some Jabber entity in our game actually suffers process death. But that doesn't cover all cases. I am thinking:
<p>
<UL >
<li> A client might drop a Jabber-RPC message on the floor (due to infrastructure bugs)
<li> A client might hang (due to our bugs)
<li> A client might hang in ECMA code (due to game bugs -- or does the ECMA library shield us from this? I'd hope so)
<li> Network might go down, in some way that doesn't shut down TCP connections
<li> Network might become outrageously slow
<li> Players might walk away from the computer.
</UL>
<p>
(This last case isn't a Jabber-RPC timeout, and it might seem dumb, but every extant referee is a resource load. We may want code in the parlor to abort a game if there's no activity on it for N hours. (Some server-configured interval.) (See <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?Table_Timeout" class=wikipagelink>table timeouts</a> for this issue.)
<p>
I am willing to let the game author ignore these issues. The referee has a limited lifespan, and if there are some unresolved RPCs hanging around when the game ends, no biggie. (Although our low-level volity classes should be smart enough to free that memory.)
<p>
The parlor, however, should have some policy about hung RPCs, hung games, etc.
