<h1>Ronin</h1><div class=wikitext>A "gamebot.html" class=wikipagelink>GameBot</a> that is not under the control of any <a href="parlor.html" class=wikipagelink>Parlor</a>. It's actually a "clientapplication.html" class=wikipagelink>ClientApplication</a>-using human when it's actually a sophisticated computer program that knows how to navigate the Jabber and Volity protocols and play games, all by itself. Contrast with <a href="retainerbot.html" class=wikipagelink>RetainerBot</a>.
<p>
While ronin are not unwelcome members of the <a href="volitynet.html" class=wikipagelink>VolityNet</a> network, their creation is entirely an exercise left to the interested player/programmer; no official Volity software application or library explicitly supports them. (That said, <a href="frivolity.html" class=wikipagelink>FriVolity</a>'s Volity::Bot Perl module, currently in development, might end up being a good starting point, depending upon how it ends up...)
<p>
It is still preferred practice for a ronin to identify its <a href="volity_role.html" class=wikipagelink>role</a> as "bot", not "player".
