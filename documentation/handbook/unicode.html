<h1>Unicode</h1><div class=wikitext>Unicode is a standard for encoding the characters of just about every human language -- not to mention punctuation, dingbats, and chess pieces -- into a stream of numbers.
<p>
(Unicode also specifies a bunch of standards (notably UTF-8) for encoding that stream of numbers into a stream of bytes or words. This is where it gets complicated, but you generally don't have to worry about that.)
<p>
All the technologies used by Volity -- <a href="jabber.html" class=wikipagelink>Jabber</a>, <a href="svg.html" class=wikipagelink>SVG</a>, Java -- support Unicode. This means that Volity has the ability to support clients and game interfaces in any language.
