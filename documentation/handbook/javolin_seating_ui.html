<hr class=wikilineheader></div><div class=wikitext><H2>Introduction</H2>

<p>
This document describes the functional specification of the seating UI in Javolin. The seating UI consists of the controls appearing in a Javolin table window for managing table participants relative to seats. This UI was designed to meet the requirements laid out in <a href="seating_ui.html" class=wikipagelink>Seating UI</a>.
<p>
<H2>Background</H2>

<p>
I (Karl) had read both the <a href="seating_ui.html" class=wikipagelink>Seating UI</a> page, and JMac's <a href="/web/20070114034257/http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=11986812">[Application-level seat UI ideas]</a> message that was sent to the volity-devel mailing list, and proceeded to think about how Javolin's seating UI in a table window should look and behave. At first I was simply going to turn the existing user list into a real tree control, just like the roster in Javolin's main window. (I could then reuse this same class for the user list in the MUC window.) The list of seated users would be in a separate panel below this one. But then I realized that this would mean that seated players would appear twice; once in the user list, and once in the seat UI. A unified panel seemed best. I thought at first that a tree control would still be good, but after some thought I realized that it was not the best control. Sure I could get something working more quickly than with a custom control panel, but that would be at the expense of not having the proper tool for the job. A tree is best suited for hierarchical information, where you want to be able to collapse branches that you're not interested in. But the seating UI is not really hierarchical; it's more like a list, but with groups of items.
<p>
Ultimately, I realized that the UI that JMac had crudely marked up in ASCII in his <a href="/web/20070114034257/http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=11986812">[message]</a> was the ideal UI for the job.
<p>

<p>
<H2>User List</H2>

<p>
The most prominent component of the seating UI is the user list in the right hand side of the table window. This replaces the current plain-text user list.
<p>
<H3>Appearance</H3>

<p>
The nicknames of all participants at the table are displayed in the user list, each in a different color. This is the same as the current user list's behavior. The colors do not have any relation to the "player colors" in the game being played, but are merely used to visually associate participants with their chat messages.
<p>
For every seat in the game, there is a group box containing the seat name at the top, and a list of players sitting in the seat. Any seat that does not contain a player has the text &lt;empty&gt; where a player would be, but horizontally centered in the box. Below the seat group boxes is a list of non-seated participants.
<p>
All participants have an icon next to their name. There are three icons; one for non-seated participants, one for seated but unready players, and one for seated and ready players. <strong>Note</strong> that these icons already exist in the Javolin source tree, in the org.volity.javolin.game package. They are called  Standing_TreeIcon<a href="action.html=edit&id=TreeIcon" class=wikipageedit>?</a>.png, Seated_TreeIcon<a href="action.html=edit&id=TreeIcon" class=wikipageedit>?</a>.png, and Ready_TreeIcon<a href="action.html=edit&id=TreeIcon" class=wikipageedit>?</a>.png respectively.
<p>
<H3>Behavior</H3>

<p>
The user list supports drag and drop for seating. The user can drag his/her name into a seat to sit down, or from one seat to another to change seats, or into the standing participants area to stand up. The user can also drag other users around in the same manner to seat or unseat them, as allowed by Volity.
<p>
Right-clicking on a user name brings up a contextual menu. The items in the menu are:
<p>
<UL >
<li> Sit
<li> Ready
<li> ---
<li> Chat
</UL>
<p>
The first item is either "Sit" or "Stand", depending on whether the user clicked is standing or sitting. The "Sit" command will put the user into a seat arbitrarily chosen by the game referee. 
<p>
The second menu item is "Ready" or "Unready", depending on whether the user is unready or ready. If the user is standing, this item is "Ready", but is disabled. (Like the contextual menu in the roster in Javolin's main window, inapplicable items do not disappear based on context; all menus are the same, with items enabling/disabling based on context.)
<p>
Below this is a divider, followed by generic non-gaming specific commands, such as "Chat". The "Chat" command will initiate chat with the selected user, just like it does in the roster in Javolin's main window.
<p>
<H3>Implementation</H3>

<p>
Just like trees, lists, and tables in Swing have both a UI component and a corresponding data model class, there should be some kind of data model class for the user list. Let's call this class PlayerPoolModel<a href="action.html=edit&id=PlayerPoolModel" class=wikipageedit>?</a>. (It's not the greatest name, so feel free to pick a better one.) The PlayerPoolModel<a href="action.html=edit&id=PlayerPoolModel" class=wikipageedit>?</a> would be a container for a set of instances of a class called something like GamePlayer<a href="action.html=edit&id=GamePlayer" class=wikipageedit>?</a>. Each GamePlayer<a href="action.html=edit&id=GamePlayer" class=wikipageedit>?</a> represents a participant at the game table, and contains a user's nickname, display color, and standing/seated/ready state. The model also has a list of seats, and a way of mapping participants to seats. PlayerPoolModel<a href="action.html=edit&id=PlayerPoolModel" class=wikipageedit>?</a> has methods that the user list UI can query in order to know how and where to render everyone. 
<p>
The model must be kept in sync with the state of the game. Ideally, there should be a simple way to query the game table to find out who's there and who's in which seat, and thus populate the model from scratch every time an event is received indicating a change to the participants or seating. This is how the roster works now; when a roster event is received, the list is repopulated from scratch. I believe that this implementation pattern is cleaner and less error prone than making incremental changes to a model  based on each event at the time it is received.
<p>
The actual UI component class showing the user list, which we'll call PlayerPoolView<a href="action.html=edit&id=PlayerPoolView" class=wikipageedit>?</a>, is a fancy subclass of JPanel. It lays out the seats and players according to its PlayerPoolModel<a href="action.html=edit&id=PlayerPoolModel" class=wikipageedit>?</a> instance. A class called something like SeatPanel<a href="action.html=edit&id=SeatPanel" class=wikipageedit>?</a> is a JPanel-based component that renders a filled rounded rectangle around its edge, with a seat name displayed in a bold, smallish font in the upper left corner, and a list of players with appropriate icons below that. If there are no players, it renders an &lt;empty&gt; label instead, in grey at 25% brightness.
<p>
The PlayerPoolView<a href="action.html=edit&id=PlayerPoolView" class=wikipageedit>?</a> renders a list of SeatPanel<a href="action.html=edit&id=SeatPanel" class=wikipageedit>?</a> instances tiled vertically with a few pixels of whitespace in between, with unseated players rendered in a list below this. This effect shouldn't be too hard to achieve with intelligent use of GridBagLayout<a href="action.html=edit&id=GridBagLayout" class=wikipageedit>?</a>, both in the PlayerPoolView<a href="action.html=edit&id=PlayerPoolView" class=wikipageedit>?</a> and in each SeatPanel<a href="action.html=edit&id=SeatPanel" class=wikipageedit>?</a>.
<p>
The PlayerPoolView<a href="action.html=edit&id=PlayerPoolView" class=wikipageedit>?</a> should be in a JScrollPane<a href="action.html=edit&id=JScrollPane" class=wikipageedit>?</a> so that a vertical scrollbar can appear if the list gets long.
<p>
When the user list area is resized horizontally, the SeatPanels<a href="action.html=edit&id=SeatPanels" class=wikipageedit>?</a> should always stretch to fill the space horizontally. This is easily achieved using GridBagConstraints<a href="action.html=edit&id=GridBagConstraints" class=wikipageedit>?</a>.HORIZONTAL for the "fill" value of the cell containing the SeatPanel<a href="action.html=edit&id=SeatPanel" class=wikipageedit>?</a> in the PlayerPoolView<a href="action.html=edit&id=PlayerPoolView" class=wikipageedit>?</a>'s GridBagLayout<a href="action.html=edit&id=GridBagLayout" class=wikipageedit>?</a>. However, the panel should probably never resize to be too small to fit the longest name contained in any seat. Making sure that the minimumSize of each JLabel (or whatever) displaying the player's name is set properly might be sufficient to ensure this. Either it should be physically impossible for the user to make this panel too narrow, or a horizontal scroll bar should appear when it is.
<p>
The border of the seat rectangle is 50% grey, and the fill color is a pale grey, with a brighness of 92%. If the Volity API is fancy enough to indicate game colors for the seats, the border and fill colors can be tinted appropriately, at the same brighness values, to indicate which seat is which player color. At 92% brighness, the background color is pale enough not to clash with the player name colors contained within.
<p>
There is no need for a participant name to be selectable. I.e., there's no need for the user to click on a name, and have that name be highlighted to indicate that it is "selected". However, it might make sense to highlight a participant name when the user right-clicks it, to give a visual cue as to which participant the contextual menu applies to. 
<p>
When dragging and dropping a participant, the fill color of a seat's rectangle should darken while the mouse moves over it during the drag.
<p>
I am not sure how the "Chat" command in the contextual menu should be handled, along with any other generic non-game-specific commands. Ideally, choosing this menu item should somehow result in a call to JavolinApp<a href="action.html=edit&id=JavolinApp" class=wikipageedit>?</a>.chatWithUser<a href="action.html=edit&id=WithUser" class=wikipageedit>?</a>(). The question is how to make the connection cleanly. One way is for the JavolinApp<a href="action.html=edit&id=JavolinApp" class=wikipageedit>?</a> to implement some kind of Listener interface for events that the TableWindow<a href="action.html=edit&id=TableWindow" class=wikipageedit>?</a> class can trigger in response to these menu items. Another is for there to be a public static method of JavolinApp<a href="action.html=edit&id=JavolinApp" class=wikipageedit>?</a> that can be called to return the JavolinApp<a href="action.html=edit&id=JavolinApp" class=wikipageedit>?</a> instance, and methods such as chatWithUser<a href="action.html=edit&id=WithUser" class=wikipageedit>?</a>() can be made public.
<p>
<H2>Toolbar</H2>

<p>
At the top of the table window is a toolbar, containing two buttons. The first is the Sit/Stand<a href="action.html=edit&id=Javolin_Seating_UI/Stand" class=wikipageedit>?</a> button. When the user is standing, it has an icon evocative of sitting, and a tooltip of "Sit". Clicking it seats the player in 
a seat arbitrarily chosen by the game referee, just like the "Sit" command on the contextual menu in the user list. When the user is seated, the button contains an icon evocative of standing, and causes the user to stand when clicked.
<p>
The second button is a Ready/Unready<a href="action.html=edit&id=Javolin_Seating_UI/Unready" class=wikipageedit>?</a> button, which works in the same manner. The icon toggles depending on whether it is a "Ready" or "Unready" button, as does the tooltip text, and has the same effect as the "Ready" and "Unready" contextual menu items. It is only enabled when the user is sitting. When the user is standing, it appears as a disabled "Ready" button.
<p>
Note that the icons for these buttons do not exist yet. I just threw something together for the screen mockup.
<p>
<strong><a href="zarf.html" class=wikipagelink>Zarf</a>'s implementation of the toolbar buttons:</strong>
<p>
This is what I have so far. (In these images, the user list is still the old-style plain text list.)

<p>
I went with labelled icon buttons, because mystery meat is evil. (I like the result -- I would like to change the main-window toolbar to also have labels.) The choice of labels was a little hinky: should the label change when the button changes state? ("Sit" to "Stand", etc.) I don't like that option -- it leads to a button which reads "Stand" when you're sitting and "Sit" when you're standing, which is confusing. Instead, I went with a less verb-like "Seat", which remains fixed.
