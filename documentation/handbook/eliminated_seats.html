<h1>Eliminated Seats</h1><div class=wikitext>It is possible, in some games, that a seat will be eliminated from the game before the game is over. The referee makes this determination; an eliminated seat is one from which no further game decisions will be required. (For example, a Monopoly player who runs out of money is eliminated from the game.) 
<p>
Elimination is not always the same as losing the game. One could imagine a racing game, where the first player across the line wins, but is then "eliminated" (he has nothing to do for the rest of the game, except watch the other players jockey for second place.)
<p>
Elimination is significant because <a href="user_departure.html" class=wikipagelink>departure</a> from an eliminated seat is always nondisruptive. The referee does not need to take any action when an eliminated seat is empty.
