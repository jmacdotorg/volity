<hr class=wikilineheader></div><div class=wikitext>Running the Perl Volity apps on Mac OS X 10.4
<p>
This is everything I (<a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?Zarf" class=wikipagelink>Zarf</a>) had to do to get the server-perl and games-perl packages running on my Mac. The instructions should be pretty close for any Unix system, if you're willing to build Perl modules from source. (If not, see <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?FrivolityPerlPrereqs" class=wikipagelink>FrivolityPerlPrereqs</a>.)
<p>
This is not guaranteed to be a complete list, because I didn't start with a perfectly stock 10.4 install. I already had some Fink packages installed.
<p>
There are many non-optimal steps here. It's not perfect, it's what I did.
<p>
<H2>Preliminary packages</H2>

<p>
Using Fink, or some other Unix package system, install:
<p>
<UL >
<li> gnupg
<li> wget
<li> expat
</UL>
<p>
<H2>Setting up CPAN</H2>

<p>
CPAN is a Perl module for building and installing Perl modules. It has a command shell, which was designed by Perl fanatics. <em>You can just tell.</em> However, it gets the job done.
<p>
Since you're installing Perl modules in system folders (<tt>/Library/Perl/</tt>), you have to run it as root. Thus the "sudo" in the following command, which you should now type:
<p>
<PRE >
   sudo perl -MCPAN -e shell
</PRE>
<p>
The first time you do this, CPAN will run through a long configuration sequence. You can keep hitting Return to choose the default everything. The only exception is when it asks you for some CPAN archive mirrors. There's a big list there; pick some that look geographically close.
<p>
<H2>Installing modules</H2>

<p>
You are now at the "cpan&gt;" prompt. (Or, get to it by typing the line above.) Type:
<p>
<PRE >
   install Module::Build
</PRE>
<p>
Hopefully, CPAN will do its thing: fetch the source, compile it, run unit tests, and install it.
<p>
You now get to install a bunch more packages. This ought to be simple, but there are wrinkles. See footnotes.
<p>
Install these packages, in this order:
<p>
<UL >
<li> Module::Build
<li> LWP (*)
<li> YAML
<li> POE
<li> POE::Filter::XML
<li> POE::Component::Jabber
<li> Class::Fields (*)
<li> Class::Accessor
<li> Date::Format
<li> Date::Parse
<li> PXR::Node
<li> RPC::XML (*)
<li> Log::Log4perl
<li> Data::<a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?JavaScript" class=wikipagelink>JavaScript</a>::Anon
<li> XML::Parser (**)
<li> Class::Data::Inheritable
<li> XML::SAX::Expat
<li> XML::SAX::Expat::Incremental
<li> <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?JavaScript" class=wikipagelink>JavaScript</a>::<a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?SpiderMonkey" class=wikipagelink>SpiderMonkey</a> (***)
</UL>
<p>
(* This failed for me at the testing stage ("make test"). I went ahead and installed anyway, and it hasn't blown up yet. To force the install, type (for example) <tt>force install LWP</tt>.)
<p>
(** XML::Parser got cranky about finding the expat library, even though I had it installed. I think this formula will work, from the CPAN shell:
<PRE >
   look XML::Parser
   perl Makefile.PL EXPATLIBPATH=/sw/lib EXPATINCPATH=/sw/include
   make
   make install
   exit
</PRE>
The <tt>look</tt> CPAN command starts a regular Unix shell in the source directory, so the following four lines are all at a shell prompt. <tt>/sw/lib</tt> and <tt>/sw/include</tt> are where Fink put the expat library.)
<p>
(*** <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?SpiderMonkey" class=wikipagelink>SpiderMonkey</a> is its own pain in the butt. See below.)
<p>
<H2><a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?SpiderMonkey" class=wikipagelink>SpiderMonkey</a></H2>

<p>
<a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?SpiderMonkey" class=wikipagelink>SpiderMonkey</a> is the Mozilla library that implements <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?JavaScript" class=wikipagelink>JavaScript</a>. You have to fetch it from <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey">http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey</a> and build and install it.
<p>
This would be easy, except that JavaScript-SpiderMonkey -- the Perl interface to <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?SpiderMonkey" class=wikipagelink>SpiderMonkey</a> -- is constructed weird. It wants the library in a particular place. Which is not a good place. I'm not even going to pretend that I found the right way to manage this. Here's my terrible way. First, get the source (<tt>js-1.5-rc6a.tar.gz</tt> as I write this). Then, from the command line (not CPAN), get a root shell:
<p>
<pre>
   sudo sh
   cd ~/.cpan/build
   tar zxfv js-1.5-rc6a.tar.gz
   cd js/src
   make -f Makefile.ref
   cp Darwin_DBG.OBJ/libjs.a Darwin_DBG.OBJ/libjs.so /usr/local/lib
   ranlib /usr/local/lib/libjs.a
</pre>
<p>
Then, within CPAN:
<p>
<pre>
   look JavaScript::SpiderMonkey
   perl Makefile.PL
</pre>
<p>
Now, I'm sorry to say, you have to get into a text editor and hack the Makefile. There are two lines:
<p>
<pre>
   EXTRALIBS = -L/Users/zarf/.cpan/build/JavaScript-SpiderMonkey-0.11/../js/src/Darwin_DBG.OBJ -ljs
   LDLOADLIBS = -L/Users/zarf/.cpan/build/JavaScript-SpiderMonkey-0.11/../js/src/Darwin_DBG.OBJ -ljs
</pre>
<p>
(Only with your username, of course.) Change these to:
<p>
<pre>
   EXTRALIBS = -L/usr/local/lib -ljs
   LDLOADLIBS = -L/usr/local/lib -ljs
</pre>
<p>
Right. Back to your root command shell. You should now be able to do:
<p>
<PRE >
   make
   make test
   make install
</PRE>
<p>
And then <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?SpiderMonkey" class=wikipagelink>SpiderMonkey</a> will be installed, and you can go back to daydreaming about disemboweling whoever thought this was a good idea.
<p>
<H2>Installing Volity</H2>

<p>
This is easier, because you can't use CPAN. Get these modules off the Volity <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?SVN" class=wikipagelink>SVN</a>:
<p>
<UL >
<li> server-perl
<li> games-perl
<li> games-ui
</UL>
<p>
Cd into <tt>server-perl</tt>, and do:
<p>
<pre>
   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   sudo ./Build install
</pre>
<p>
Repeat this in <tt>games-perl/rps</tt> and <tt>games-perl/eights</tt>.
<p>
<H2>Running a game server</H2>

<p>
First, you need a bunch of Jabber IDs: one for the server, and one for each player you want to run. I do not know a good way to get Jabber IDs. I have a bad way and I'm hoping I don't have to explain it.
<p>
To start the server:
<p>
<PRE >
   /usr/local/volity/bin/volityd -u JABBERNAME -p PASSWORD -h JABBERHOST -g Volity::Game::RPS
</PRE>
<p>
This starts a <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?RockPaperScissors" class=wikipagelink>RockPaperScissors</a> server using the Jabber ID JABBERNAME@JABBERHOST. Yes, you have to give the password on the command line.
<p>
Now, in a different window:
<p>
<PRE >
   /usr/local/volity/bin/friv -u JABBERNAME2 -h JABBERHOST -p PASSWORD2
</PRE>
<p>
It has to be a different name. You should now be at a <tt>Volity&gt;</tt> prompt.
<p>
<PRE >
   load_ui games-ui/rps/text/rps.js
   new_table zarfvolitytest@jabber.org/volity
   sit
</PRE>
<p>
You need another player. So, in a third window:
<p>
<PRE >
   /usr/local/volity/bin/friv -u JABBERNAME3 -h JABBERHOST -p PASSWORD3
   load_ui games-ui/rps/text/rps.js
   join_table TABLEID
   sit
</PRE>
<p>
(The TABLEID is displayed by the <tt>new_table</tt> command from the first player.)
<p>
You can now type <tt>ready</tt> in both player windows to begin the game. The moves are <tt>select rock</tt>, <tt>select paper</tt>, <tt>select scissors</tt>. When each player moves, the game ends.
<p>
<H2>Problems</H2>

<p>
I get this warning a lot:
<p>
<pre>
   Warning: Use of "shift" without parentheses is ambiguous at /Library/Perl/5.8.6/POE/Component/Jabber/Client/Legacy.pm line 320.
</pre>
<p>
Ignore it.
<p>
I can't get bots to work. Yes, I added <tt>-B Volity::Bot::RPS</tt> on the volityd command. The <tt>add_bot</tt> command returns "ok", but the server generates:
<p>
<pre>
   AUTHENTICATION FAILED at /Library/Perl/5.8.6/POE/Component/Jabber/Client/Legacy.pm line 299.
</pre>
<p>
The server tends to die if I ctrl-C a friv client.
