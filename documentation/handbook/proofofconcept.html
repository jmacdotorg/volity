<hr class=wikilineheader></div><div class=wikitext>The original idea for the proof-of-concept piece involved releasing a text-only game client, but we've sense allowed mission creep to sweep us along to being satisfied only with a graphical client that people could actually use. So, we now we're looking forward to the <a href="/web/20101130123759/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?JavaClient" class=wikipagelink>JavaClient</a>.
<p>
The momentous event I thought the PoC<a href="/web/20101130123759/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?action=edit&id=PoC" class=wikipageedit>?</a> would be has been replaced with the public release of the first chapter of the <a href="/web/20101130123759/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?VolityBook" class=wikipagelink>VolityBook</a>.
<p>
The software that this outline described eventually became real, in the form of the <a href="/web/20101130123759/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?Frivolity" class=wikipagelink>Frivolity</a> server system and the <a href="/web/20101130123759/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?Friv" class=wikipagelink>Friv</a> text-based client.
<p>
<H3>Basic Outline (OLD)</H3>

<p>
- Create a game server
<PRE >
    - It should play a text-based guessing game.
        - Rules: Game picks a number between 1 and 100. Players take
          turns guessing the number; first correct guess wins. After
          incorrect guesses, the game tells all players whether the
          guess was too high or too low.
        - All communication takes place over 'normal' chatting. Players
          send their guesses to the game server as normal chat
          messages. The server ignores chats from players if its not
          their turn, and tries to parse it otherwise. (The chat
          message should be just a number, in this case.) Likewise, the
          server uses normal chatting to tell players about the game's
          progress, though it will 'whisper' human-readable error
          messages to individual users if it rejects or can't
          understand their messages to it.
    - The URI of this game is
      &lt;<a href="/web/20101130123759/http://www.jmac.org/migs/100_guessing_game&gt">http://www.jmac.org/migs/100_guessing_game&gt</a>;
    - It should implement the basic flow of a MIGS game.
        - It responds to the Jabber-RPC call 'new_game' by starting a
          conference on a server, sending presence to that conference,
          and then inviting the player in. This will try sending a
          'summon_player' RPC message to that player's client, and if
          that fails, it will invite the player into the conference
          through normal Jabbery means.
        - When someone calls 'start_game' on it, it will determine if
          the command came from sharing a conference with it, and if
          so, start a game between all the players in that conference.
          In the case of this particular server, the person who made
          the start_game call gets to go first.
        - Play continues until one of the following happens:
            - Someone guesses the number. Game ends, and
              victory-handling ensues (see below). The conference
              remains, and players are free to send a new start_game
              RPC call to the present server, if they wish.
            - All players leave the conference. Game ends, and the
              server leaves the conference too (which will destroy it,
              as per normal Jabber behavior).
                - Note: Different games should have different reactions
                  to players leaving. It's OK for someone to leave the
                  guessing game, so long as anyone is left, but it
                  wouldn't be OK to leave a Chess game. So, consider
                  implemententing an internal method on the game
                  server, called whenever a player leaves, that looks
                  at the new game status and determines whether or not
                  to call it a wash, and if not, possibly updates the
                  players on things (for example, sending out a new
                  copy of the Risk board with all the retired player's
                  armies now gone).
    - It should handle player victories, and related record-keeping.
        - When a player wins a game, the game server sends all the
          players PGP-signed documents representing the game's record.
</PRE>
- Create a game client
<PRE >
    - This should be a very simple Jabber client.
        - Chat-message send and receive
        - Conference joining and exiting, and conference-level chatting
        - Does not (yet) need rosters or anything.
    - It should also be able to send and receive basic MIGS-protocol
      RPC methods.
        - Calls it can make
            - new_game: sent to a game server JID, regardless of
              presence. Request to "set up a new table". On success,
              will result in summon_player being called back on the
              client.
            - start_game: sent to a game server JID with presence in a
              conference that the client also has presence in. (Error
              results if we're not sharing a conf with this JID.) It's
              a request to start a new game in this conference, with
              the present players. (Server sends back error if game is
              in progress.)
        - Calls it can receive
            - summon_player: Sent from a game server sitting in a
              conference. If necessary, includes, as an arg, the JID of
              this conference. The client should respond by immediately
              sending presence to this conference. (To the human
              player, it will seem as if he made a request of a game
              JID to play a game (via the new_game RPC method), and
              *bamf* he immediately appears in a new game-conference
              with the game server, waiting for other players to join.)
    - It should allow viewing of players' games records (both this
      player and other players').
        - For this test run, we can simply display # of wins and # of
          games played, even though game records can contain more info
          than that.
        - For a given player, victory records are grouped by game (the
          canonical name of which are the games' URIs) and then
          subgrouped by server.
    - It should allow queries, via RPC, from other clients about its
      game records.
        - Idea: If called without arg, returns a list of of all game
          URIs this player has records for. If called with game URI,
          returns all records for that game.
