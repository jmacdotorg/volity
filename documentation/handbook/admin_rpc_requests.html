<hr class=wikilineheader></div><div class=wikitext>These are additional <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?RPC_Requests" class=wikipagelink>RPC requests</a> which an administrator might want to use. The idea is that a server (and its referees) would only accept these RPCs from a <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?JID" class=wikipagelink>JID</a> which (bare-)matched an "administrator JID", set at server startup time.
<p>
These are not part of the Volity spec. However, they will be required for an administrator to manage parlors hosted on <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?Volity.Net" class=wikipagelink>volity.net</a>. So the Perl and Python game libraries both support all of these RPCs.
<p>
<em>Possible additions: admin.log_level, to change the logging level? Would have to have a rough correspondence between Perl and Python logging levels. Also a way for the web control panel to view logs.</em>
<p>
<H2>Parlor RPCs</H2>

<p>
<DL >
<dt>admin.status()<dd> Return a struct of summary information.
<DL >
<dt>online <em>boolean</em> <dd> is the server online?
<dt>startup_time <em>string</em> <dd> when was this parlor started?
<dt>startup_at <em>string</em> <dd> how long ago was this parlor started?
<dt>last_new_table <em>string</em> <dd> how long ago was a table started?
<dt>tables_running <em>int</em> <dd> how many tables are currently open?
<dt>tables_started <em>int</em> <dd> how many tables have been opened since the parlor began running?
</DL>
<dt>admin.list_tables()<dd> Return a list of referee JIDs.
<dt>admin.list_bots()<dd> Return a list of bot JIDs from all the tables of this parlor.
<dt>admin.online(<em>bool</em>)<dd> Set the server online or offline. When offline, the server rejects new_table requests (but allows existing games to continue).
<dt>admin.announce(<em>string</em>)<dd> Have all referees send this message (as a groupchat) to their tables.
<dt>admin.shutdown()<dd> Immediately shut down the parlor and all referees; end the parlor process.
<dt>admin.restart()<dd> Immediately shut down the parlor and all referees, then relaunch the parlor process.
<dt>admin.graceful_shutdown()<dd> Log out the parlor, but keep its active referees alive. Shut down the parlor process after all of its referees have met their natural ends.
<dt>admin.graceful_restart()<dd> Log out the parlor, but keep its active referees alive. Launch a new server process, which will log in as the new active parlor. Shut down the original parlor process after all of its referees have met their natural ends. (This is a "graceful" restart, in the Apache sense.)
</DL>
