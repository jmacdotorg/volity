<h1>Table Configuration</h1><div class=wikitext><strong>Configuration</strong> allows players seated at a <a href="table.html" class=wikipagelink>table</a> to specify certain attributes and behaviors for it. These come in two basic types: <strong>table configuration</strong>, which defines some attributes common to all tables and defined by the core Volity protocol, and <strong>game configuration</strong>, which sets up rules and other features specific to the table's <a href="ruleset.html" class=wikipagelink>ruleset</a>.
<p>
In either case, players perform configuration by sending certain <a href="jabber-rpc.html" class=wikipagelink>Jabber-RPC</a> requests to the table's <a href="referee.html" class=wikipagelink>referee</a>. Conversely, players are informed about changes to a table's configuration through RPC requests sent from the same referee.
<p>
<H2>Table configuration</H2>

<p>
All volity tables have several attributes that are always configurable, regardless of their loaded ruleset. Players can configure these attributes using certain <a href="rpc_requests.html" class=wikipagelink>RPC requests</a> in the core <code>volity</code> namespace. At present, the protocol defines the following configuration requests:
<p>
<DL >
<dt>volity.show_table( true | false )<dd>Defines whether or not the table is visible through the <a href="game_browser.html" class=wikipagelink>game browser</a>.
<dt>volity.record_games( true | false )<dd>Defines whether or not <a href="game_record.html" class=wikipagelink>game record</a>s are sent to the <a href="bookkeeper.html" class=wikipagelink>bookkeeper</a>.
<dt>volity.set_language(<em>language code</em>)<dd>Defines the preferred <a href="language.html" class=wikipagelink>language</a> to be used at the table. The argument is a two-letter language code.
<dt>volity.set_timeout(<em>seconds</em>)<dd>Defines the length of this table's <a href="table_timeout.html" class=wikipagelink>timeout</a>. The argument is a positive integer.
<dt>volity.set_timeout_reaction(<em>reaction-type</em>)<dd>Defines what the referee will do upon a <a href="user_departure.html" class=wikipagelink>user departure</a> timeout. The argument is a string, one of "throw", "suspend" or "bot".
</DL>
<p>
<H2>Game configuration</H2>

<p>
<a href="ruleset.html" class=wikipagelink>Ruleset</a>s are free to define any sort of configuration functions in their <a href="ruleset_api.html" class=wikipagelink>ruleset API</a>s as they see fit. However, a ruleset <em>should</em> be carefully specific about which functions are meant for configuration, and which are intended to be called once a game is underway. 
<p>
These functions operate like any other game-specific RPC request, existing within the <code>game</code> namespace.
<p>
As an example, see the <code>best_of</code> and <code>no_ties</code> functions in the <a href="rock,_paper,_scissors.html" class=wikipagelink>rock, paper, scissors</a> API.
<p>
A <a href="referee.html" class=wikipagelink>referee</a> can implement as many or as few of a ruleset's configuration methods as it wishes. <em>(Should we define some sort of disco-based query pattern for asking a server what sorts of config it supports?) (Would be easier to just allow server config variables, which the game module reads. This puts more work on the game designer -- he has to write code to constrain his own config system -- but it avoids issues with possibly inconsistent configurations.)</em>
<p>
<H2>The effect of reconfiguation</H2>

<p>
When a player succeeds in changing any part of a table's configuration, several things happen.
<p>
<UL >
<li> All players who have declared <a href="readiness.html" class=wikipagelink>readiness</a> get knocked back to an unready state. After all, the nature of the game has changed away from the format they had agreed upon. 
</UL>
<p>
<UL >
<li> The referee sends a RPC request to every player, informing it of the configuration change. Generally, the call contains two arguments: the <a href="jid.html" class=wikipagelink>JID</a> of the player who made the request, and the new value. The <a href="rpc_requests.html" class=wikipagelink>RPC requests</a> page defines several of these (such as <code>volity.language( JID, language)</code>, and rulesets can define as many more as they need.
</UL>
<p>
<UL >
<li> If the reconfiguration affected the game's rules, then the table's full <a href="ruleset_uri.html" class=wikipagelink>ruleset URI</a> changes appropriately. Its base part remains the same, but its query string adjusts itself to reflect the new rule change.
</UL>
<p>
<UL >
<li> If the reconfiguration used one of the <code>volity.*</code> calls, then the referee adjusts how it responds to disco<a href="action=edit&id=disco.html" class=wikipageedit>?</a> queries, as defined by the <a href="game_finder.html" class=wikipagelink>game finder</a> page.
</UL>
