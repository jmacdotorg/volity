<h1>Ruleset URI</h1><div class=wikitext>Every Volity <a href="http://volity.org/games/rps</code>. All ruleset URIs <em>must</em> be perfectly compliant with <a href="/web/20070802131051/http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt">[Internet RFC-2396]</a>, the standard URI syntax rules.
<p>
As with URIs found throughout the world of Internet protocols, each ruleset URI serves multiple functions.
<p>
<UL >
<li> Since a given URI is guaranteed to be unique across the entire Internet, assigning a URI to a Volity ruleset gives it a label and a namespace that is always unambigious. Volity uses rulesets in this manner for sub-applications such as the <a href="ui_finder.html" class=wikipagelink>UI finder</a>.
<li> Thorough Volity designers will also have their rulesets' URIs serve double-duty as URLs pointing to Web pages describing the rulesets in detail.
</UL>
<p>
<H2>Ruleset URIs in game records</H2>

<p>
Ruleset URIs are also a key component of <a href="game_record.html" class=wikipagelink>game record</a>s, indicating the type of game that the rest of the record describes. However, because <a href="table_configuration.html" class=wikipagelink>table configuration</a> can change what rules are active at a given <a href="table.html" class=wikipagelink>table</a>, effectively making the game played there slighty different. When preparing a game record, the <a href="referee.html" class=wikipagelink>referee</a> acknowledges this difference by appending a query string to the recorded ruleset URI, holding one or more key/value pairs for every configuration variable that the ruleset defines. The ruleset also defines the syntax for each part of the query string.
<p>
So, to continue the above example, the game record of an <a href="rps.html" class=wikipagelink>RPS</a> game that allowed ties but was a best-of-three contest would claim a URI of <code>http://volity.org/games/rps?no_ties=0&amp;best_of=3</code>.
<p>
<em>Since URIs get compared string-wise, the referee will have to maintain a canonical order of key/value pairs.</em>
