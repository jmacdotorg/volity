<h1>User</h1><div class=wikitext>A <strong>user</strong> is simply an individual entity on the Volity network, either human or <a href="bot.html" class=wikipagelink>bot</a>.
<p>
This may seem self-evident, but it's important to understand Volity's distinction between a user and a <a href="seat.html" class=wikipagelink>seat</a>, as the latter can contain multiple users. Quite often we can use the two terms interchangably, as a user playing a game is usually alone in its role, but this will not always be the case.
