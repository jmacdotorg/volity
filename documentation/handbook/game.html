<h1>Game</h1><div class=wikitext>We bat the word <strong>game</strong> around a lot when talking about Volity, since games are Volity's reason for being. However, when talking system design, the word often has a more precise meaning: a <em>single instance</em> of a game in play. In other words, the thing that happens at a Volity <a href="table.html" class=wikipagelink>table</a>. This is distinct from the <em>concept</em> of the game as a collection of rules for play, which we call <a href="ruleset.html" class=wikipagelink>ruleset</a>s, or the entities on the network you connect to in order to play games -- the <a href="parlor.html" class=wikipagelink>parlor</a>s.
<p>
Mind your context and all will be well.
