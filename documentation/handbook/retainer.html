<h1>Retainer</h1><div class=wikitext>A "bot.html" class=wikipagelink>game bot</a> that is attached to a particular <a href="parlor.html" class=wikipagelink>parlor</a>, so that players may summon it (or, more correctly, instances of it) to <a href="table.html" class=wikipagelink>tables</a> on that server. Compare to <a href="ronin.html" class=wikipagelink>ronin</a>.
<p>
These bots are summoned by the add_bot() <a href="rpc_requests.html" class=wikipagelink>Jabber-RPC request</a>, made from a player to a referee.
<p>
It's up to the referee to know what bots it offers, and when it's legal to add them to its table -- it could be limited by table space, computing resources, and so on. If a ref that offers more than one bot-type receives an add_bot request when table-space is available, then it initiates the <a href="bot_choosing.html" class=wikipagelink>bot choosing</a> procedure, sending a <a href="jabber_data_form.html" class=wikipagelink>Jabber data form</a> to the client, and creating a new bot based on the client's response.

Throughout Volity documentation, references to "bots" usually mean retainers. Ronin programming is an interesting exercise, and is an exercise left to programmers. :)
