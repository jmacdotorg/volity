<h1>Parlor</h1><div class=wikitext>A <strong>parlor</strong> (formerly "jabber_entity.html" class=wikipagelink>Jabber entity</a> with a <a href="jid.html" class=wikipagelink>JID</a> that listens for requests over the network. These can be <a href="service_discovery.html" class=wikipagelink>service discovery</a> requests from players wishing to know more about the parlor, or (more interestingly) <a href="rpc_requests.html" class=wikipagelink>RPC requests</a> from players who want to create a new game <a href="table.html" class=wikipagelink>table</a> there.
<p>
A parlor "ruleset.html" class=wikipagelink>ruleset</a>. This might be Chess, Backgammon, <a href="rock,_paper,_scissors.html" class=wikipagelink>Rock, Paper, Scissors</a>, or anything else that someone has turned into a Volity game. It doesn't play the game itself, but instead manages several <a href="table.html" class=wikipagelink>table</a>s, each with its own, autonomous <a href="referee.html" class=wikipagelink>referee</a>.
<p>
<H2>Running a parlor</H2>

<p>
Anyone can run a parlor! That's part of what makes the Volity idea so cool, after all; it's an entirely open game network.
<p>
Running a parlor entails obtaining and then running a parlor program, such as <a href="frivolity.html" class=wikipagelink>Frivolity</a>. Generally, a parlor often ships as more of a framework than a single, self-running game, and you have to plug a separate game module into it before it will run.
<p>
Every parlor needs its own <a href="jabber_id.html" class=wikipagelink>Jabber ID</a>, just like every other entity on the global Jabber network. It should also be registered with the Volity network's <a href="bookkeeper.html" class=wikipagelink>bookkeeper</a>, if you want <a href="game_record.html" class=wikipagelink>game record</a>s to work. Unfortunately, until the <a href="volitynet.html" class=wikipagelink>VolityNet</a> website is up and running, there's no real way to do this yourself. If you do happen to have a functional parlor you'd like to add to the network, for now, contact <a href="jmac.html" class=wikipagelink>Jmac</a>.
<p>
<H2>Examples</H2>

<p>
The <a href="test_parlors.html" class=wikipagelink>test parlors</a> offer live examples that you can try with any working <a href="client.html" class=wikipagelink>client</a> program.
<p>
<H2>Current Implementations</H2>

<p>
Frameworks that implement a referee (in <a href="http://volity.org/downloads.html">[developer download page.]</a>
<p>
If you want to create a Volity game, you do not have to implement the entire referee from scratch. Download one of these frameworks, and then extend the base Game class to implement your game logic.
<p>
<H2><a href="rpc_requests.html" class=wikipagelink>RPC Requests</a></H2>

<p>
<H3>volity.new_table ()</H3>

<p>
A client calls this on a parlor when the player wishes to start a new, empty conference for that game. If the server can start a new table, it should respond to this call by creating a referee, which will start, join, and configure a new <a href="muc.html" class=wikipagelink>MUC</a>.
<p>
<UL >
<li> Returns: the <a href="jid.html" class=wikipagelink>JID</a> of the new table's MUC. The client is expected to immediately join the MUC as a result.
<li> Fault: 608: Referee failed to start, or failed to start in a reasonable length of time. Client should stay in whatever mode it was in when the player asked for a new table. (We recommend 120 seconds as "reasonable".)
</UL>
<p>
<strong>Implementation note:</strong> Remember that the parlor that created the referee needs to send back the response with the table's JID, <em>not</em> the referee that created the table.
<p>
The parlor may also respond to various <a href="admin_rpc_requests.html" class=wikipagelink>admin RPC requests</a>.
<p>
<H2><a href="service_discovery.html" class=wikipagelink>Service Discovery</a> responses</H2>

<p>
parlors should respond to <a href="service_discovery.html" class=wikipagelink>disco</a> info and items requests as follows.
<p>
<H3>Info</H3>

<p>
The parlor's identity should have <strong>category</strong> "volity" and <strong>type</strong> "parlor". The <strong>name</strong> field will hold a brief title of the game parlor, suitable for display as a window title or icon label.
<p>
More machine-readable information (useful to systems like the <a href="ui_finder.html" class=wikipagelink>UI finder</a>) is available through the attached <a href="jeps_that_volity_uses.html" class=wikipagelink>JEP-0128</a> form:
<p>
<DL >
<dt>volity-role<dd>The string <code>parlor</code>.
<dt>ruleset<dd>The URI of the ruleset that this parlor provides.
<dt>ruleset-version<dd>The version number of that ruleset which this parlor supports.
<dt>description<dd>A headline describing the game.
<dt>website<dd>Human-browsable URL for the game's website
<dt>contact-email<dd> Parlor administrator contact.
<dt>contact-jid<dd> Parlor administrator contact.
<dt>volity-version<dd> Version of the Volity spec which the parlor adheres to. (Currently 1.0.)
<dt>visible<dd> 1 if the table is visible to the <a href="game_finder.html" class=wikipagelink>game finder</a>; 0 otherwise.
</DL>
<p>
<em>Should we define a FORM_TYPE for this?</em>
<p>
Note that some elements (<code>ruleset</code>, <code>ruleset-version</code>, <code>description</code>, <code>website</code>) are representative of the game or its ruleset. Others (<code>contact-jid</code> and <code>contact-email</code>) represent the entity which hosts the parlor.
<p>
<H3>Items</H3>

<p>
The parlor responds to disco#items queries under the following nodes:
<p>
<DL >
<dt><em>no node</em><dd> Returns the following node list (open_tables, ruleset, bots).
</DL>
<p>
<DL >
<dt>open_tables<dd> Returns a list of JID pointers to all the parlor's active <a href="referee.html" class=wikipagelink>referee</a>s whose tables have not been <a href="table_configuration.html" class=wikipagelink>configured</a> to remain hidden from public discovery.
</DL>
<p>
<DL >
<dt>ruleset<dd> Returns a pointer to a node on the <a href="bookkeeper.html" class=wikipagelink>bookkeeper</a> that describes the parlor's <a href="ruleset_uri.html" class=wikipagelink>ruleset URI</a>. (Consequently, the URI itself is visible as the node part of the returned item.)
</DL>
<p>
<DL >
<dt>bots<dd> Returns a list of <a href="bot.html" class=wikipagelink>bot</a>s and <a href="bot_factory.html" class=wikipagelink>bot factories</a> recommended by the parlor. Internal bots (those that the parlors can create itself) will have the same <em>jid</em> as the parlor, and a <em>node</em> which gives the bot algorithm URI. External bots will have the <em>jid</em> of a bot factory, and a <em>node</em> which gives the bot algorithm URI. The list may also contain the <em>jid</em> of a bot factory with no <em>node</em> (in which case the client must query the factory itself). Any entry in the bots list may also have a human-readable <em>name</em>.
