<h1>Metadata</h1><div class=wikitext>We want volity <a href="ui_file.html" class=wikipagelink>UI file</a>s to contain lots of metadata. They should be self-describing, as much as possible. This enables the client to get hold of useful information just by loading the UI file. It also enables the bookkeeper to extract this information when a UI file is registered, thus simplifying the task of filling in the bookkeeper's database.
<p>
(This also applies to <a href="pluggable_resource.html" class=wikipagelink>pluggable resource</a> files, such as card deck art.)
<p>
Metadata which we want:
<p>
<UL >
<li> Creator
<li> Title (possibly in multiple languages)
<li> Description (ditto)
<li> Language or languages (which the UI supports)
<li> Date created/modified
<li> Web site
<li> Ruleset URI and version (which the UI supports)
</UL>
<p>
The generic elements (title, author, etc) are covered by the <a href="dublin_core.html" class=wikipagelink>Dublin Core</a> vocabulary. I think it's reasonable to say "Use Dublin Core where possible." The client and bookkeeper will only pay attention to a few of the DC terms, but if a developer wants to stick in more of them, that's great.
<p>
We do, however, need <a href="volity_metadata_terms.html" class=wikipagelink>our own vocabulary</a> for a few items. The "version_matching.html" class=wikipagelink>ruleset versioning</a> is its own bundle of joy.
<p>
The big question is: how do we wedge this data into an SVG file? The SVG spec supports a &lt;metadata&gt; tag <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/metadata.html">[1]</a>, but doesn't specify what you should put into it. It gives an example of an RDF document fragment containing DC data.
<p>
My current proposal is simply to stick XML-ified DC elements (and our own) directly into the &lt;metadata&gt; element. We can use xml:lang attributes to distinguish localizations of human-readable elements.
<p>
(Footnote: SVG has a &lt;title&gt; element. We scan for that as a special case alternative to &lt;dc:title&gt; in &lt;metadata&gt;.)
<p>
<H3>Further Details</H3>

<p>
The metadata can contain anything, but Volity software will mostly pay attention to three vocabularies:
<p>
<UL >
<li> <a href="dublin_core.html" class=wikipagelink>Dublin Core</a>
<li> <a href="volity_metadata_terms.html" class=wikipagelink>Volity metadata terms</a>
<li> <a href="game_metadata_terms.html" class=wikipagelink>Game metadata terms</a> (used by UI code, not by the Volity client)
</UL>
<p>
In general, XML tags and extra whitespace inside an element's character data will be ignored.
<p>
Human-readable elements (&lt;dc:title&gt;, &lt;dc:description&gt;, etc) can have an <code>xml:lang</code> attribute which specifies what language they are in. It is reasonable to supply multiple elements with the same name and different languages.
<p>
<H3>SVG Metadata Example</H3>

<p>
<PRE >
  &lt;metadata
    xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
    xmlns:volity="http://volity.org/protocol/metadata"&gt;
    &lt;dc:title&gt;Fluxx Standard Interface&lt;/dc:title&gt;
    &lt;dc:title xml:lang="pla"&gt;Uxxflay Andardstay Interfaceay&lt;/dc:title&gt;
    &lt;dc:language&gt;en&lt;/dc:language&gt;
    &lt;dc:language&gt;pla&lt;/dc:language&gt;
    &lt;volity:ruleset&gt;http://volity.org/games/fluxx#2.0&lt;/volity:ruleset&gt;
  &lt;/metadata&gt;
</PRE>
<p>
(Note that <code>pla</code> is an imaginary language code for Pig Latin.)
<p>
<H3>What about RDF?</H3>

<p>
RDF looks great until you read the spec, at which point your eyeballs start to twitch uncontrollably. Well, mine did. 
<p>
Furthermore, it's a pain to support. The primary open-source Java library for parsing RDF is Jena <a href="http://jena.sourceforge.net/">[2]</a>, which is a two-megabyte JAR file plus five or so megs of supporting JARs. Mind you, that comes with database support and a logical-inference engine for queries into the RDF model. The fact that these features are a good idea seems like evidence that RDF is too much work for our needs.
<p>
What do we lose by <em>not</em> using RDF?
<p>
<UL >
<li> Flexibility of syntax (RDF allows data to appear as either XML attributes or character data)
<li> Containers (RDF has rdf:Bag, rdf:Seq, rdf:Alt -- different ways of bundling multiple values into one position)
<li> Ability to define metadata about several resources (URIs), and to have metadata relating one resource to another
</UL>
<p>
I see no need for any of these. Flexibility is confusing. We can handle multiple values by accepting multiple elements (see &lt;dc:language&gt; in my example). And the third "feature" is actually a slight headache, which we are better off avoiding. (An RDF description wants to be about a specific URI. It is possible to specify "the URI of this file, you idiot" but it takes a bit of futzing. In my proposal, all metadata is about the SVG file that the &lt;metadata&gt; element is in.)
<p>
Another possibility is to embed code (javascript code for a UI file) which returns metadata information in response to queries. I mention this only so that we may all admire the pure badness of the idea. (The bookkeeper powering up a Javascript interpreter in order to extract info from a UI? Bleah.)
