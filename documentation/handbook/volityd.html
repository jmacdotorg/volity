<h1>Volityd</h1><div class=wikitext><strong>Volityd</strong> (the Volity Daemon, you see) is a full-featured Volity <a href="parlor.html" class=wikipagelink>parlor</a> program, though it offers a text-only, command-line interface. Like the <a href="frivolity.html" class=wikipagelink>Frivolity</a> package that it accompanies, it is written in <a href="jason_mcintosh.html" class=wikipagelink>Jason McIntosh</a>.
<p>
As its name implies, it has a user interface typical of Unix network-service daemons: it's meant to be run as a background process, and offers no interactivity once it has started. All configuration (such as specifying which game module to use) occurs on launch through command-line switches. In the future, we hope to have it support configuration files as well.

<H2>Documentation</H2>

Volityd contains embedded documentation in Perl's POD format; you can use the <code>perldoc</code> command to read it, or <code>man</code> after it's been installed. You can also <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jmac/Frivolity-0.7.1/bin/volityd">[view the docs as HTML]</a>.
