0.7.1
        - Minor bugfixes.

        - Added a 'url' key and value to the struct returned from a
          ui_info RPC call. (Yes, it will be identical to the URL
          argument that the RPC takes.)

0.7

	- Added support for payment system.

	- The library is now far more resistant to exceptions arising
          from bad RPC handling.

0.6

	- Added support for UI-choosing RPCs.

	- Added support for pluggable resource-choosing RPCs.
	
	- Added support for bot factory-related RPCs.

	- Added new database classes and SQL stuff for bot factories and 
          resources.

	- Added support for game scheduling.

	- The bookkeeper now sends back RPC faults if it receives
          strange RPC requests.

	- If the bookkeeper loses its connection to the Jabber server, it
          will attempt to reconnect, and if still not successful try
          again every few seconds.

	- There is now a logical separation between the the hostname of
	  the Jabber server that Volity entities connect to, and the host
	  part of their own JIDs. This allows proxying and such.

	- Various bugfixes.

0.5

	- Added game finder support.

        - Added support for seats.

0.4     
        - Added service discovery support.

        - Added usage of the Log::Log4perl-based logging system that
          Frivolity uses.

0.2
	- Added this Changes file.

	- Updated to take better advantage of the Volity::Info modules.

	- Added several new Volity::Info subclass modules.

	- Obviated the need to pass in a database handle.

	- Added code to store game records in the DB, since they no longer
	  have the ability to store themselves.
