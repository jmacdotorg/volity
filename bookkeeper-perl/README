This is the Volity bookkeeper software. The bookkeeper serves as
informational center for the Jabber-based Volity network, acting as
front-end to a database of player and game information.

** YOU PROBABLY DON'T NEED TO INSTALL THIS. **

This is understandably confusing to a lot of new Volity developers,
but: unless you are planning on running your own Volity _network_, you
don't need to worry about running your own bookkeeper. 

In the more likely case that you wish to create, host or simply play
games on the central Volity network, then you should probably use the
public bookkeeper running at bookkeeper@volity.net/volity . Volity's
official client application, Gamut, uses it by default, as do the Perl
and Python parlor software.

INSTALLING IT ANYWAY

OK, if you insist:

First, you need a copy of Module::Build. Yes, this is annoying. I'll
undo this requirement later.

Then edit Build.PL to make sure that things will install where you
expect. By default, the installer will place the bookeeper's daemon
program into /usr/local/volity/bin/, and will install the libraries
into your machine's usual site-perl location.

Finally, run these commands:

 perl ./Build.PL
 ./Build
 sudo ./Build install

The script bookkeeper.pl features extensive POD documentation, which
you can view by running the "perldoc" command on it.
