This is the very first release of the Volity bookkeeper software. The
bookkeeper serves as informational center for the Jabber-based Volity
network, acting as front-end to a database of player and game
information.

This release offers no documentation. It's probably of very little use
to anyone but the core Volity development team, at present.
