This is the Volity bookkeeper software. The bookkeeper serves as
informational center for the Jabber-based Volity network, acting as
front-end to a database of player and game information.

This release offers no documentation. It's probably of very little use
to anyone but the core Volity development team, at present.

You generally don't need to care about this software anyway. Unless
you are planning on running your own Volity _network_, you don't need
to worry about running your own bookkeeper. If you want to create,
host or simply play games on the central Volity network, then you can
use the public bookkeeper running at bookkeeper@volity.net/volity
. See the URLs below for further documentation.
