This is a Volity module which implements a hearts parlour, and a couple of
bots. Please see the following URL for more information about the platform:
	http://volity.org

To run a hearts parlour, you need the Frivolity perl modules installed.
	http://volity.org/projects/frivolity
They're also available on CPAN, as module Volity.  The Games::Cards, also
available on CPAN, is required as well.

After everything is installed, running the parlour is as easy as editing
inc/hearts.yml to use jabber ids that you own, and running the following
command:
	volityd -C hearts.yml

Other than that, there's not much to say here :)  It's pretty simple.  Odds
are, you're not going to want to run this module, especially if you just want
to play hearts.  Just head to http://volity.net, and jump in!
