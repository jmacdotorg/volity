This module implements the game of Tic Tac Toe for the
Volity game system. It is intended for use with Frivolity, the
pure-Perl Volity game server and framework.

You need to have the Volity modules already installed on your system
in order for this module to work. At the time of this writing, Volity
is not currently available from CPAN, but you can easily download it
from the Volity project's website at http://volity.org .

INSTALLATION

The usual dance:

 perl Makefile.PL

 make

 sudo make install

Please contact me at jmac@jmac.org with any questions or comments
about this module. Thanks!
