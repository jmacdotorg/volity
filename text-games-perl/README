THIS ENTIRE MODULE IS DEPRECATED. Its functionality has been replaced and
superceded by individual, separate game module packages. For the games that
used to be here, seek ye out Volity::Game::RPS and Volity::Game::CrazyEights.

One way to get these is via CVS; see the 'games-perl' repository in the
Voliy project on SourceForge.

This lump of code will continue to hang out on SourceForge for archival
purposes. The original README content follows this line.

------(this is this line)---------------------------------------------------

This module is a catch-all for a few simple, testworthy Volity games
written in Perl, intended for distribution with the FriVolity software
package.

It may be going away soon, as we encourage developers (including
ourselves) to released game modules as independently downlaodable
packages.

Note that the UI files found in ui_files/ecmascript aren't put
anywhere by the installer. This is because we haven't quite figured
out how to best distribute UI files yet, let alone, where they should
live locally.
