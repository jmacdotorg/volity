This module is a catch-all for a few simple, testworthy Volity games
written in Perl, intended for distribution with the FriVolity software
package.

It may be going away soon, as we encourage developers (including
ourselves) to released game modules as independently downlaodable
packages.

Note that the UI files found in ui_files/ecmascript aren't put
anywhere by the installer. This is because we haven't quite figured
out how to best distribute UI files yet, let alone, where they should
live locally.
