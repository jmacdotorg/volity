    <title>Running the server</title>
    <para>
      To make your game actually run, launch the
      <literal>server.pl</literal> script that ships with the
      Frivolity software, supplying your module's classname as an
      argument. You will need to supply additional arguments to
      specify important connection information (such as your server's
      Jabber account name), as detailed in the script's manpage.
    </para>
    <para>
      Once the server successfully launches, it runs as a "headless",
      noninteractive process until it terminates, either through user
      intervention (i.e. you send it a <literal>kill</literal> signal)
      or because it crashed (in which case you should notify
      me).
    </para>
    <para>
      This, combined with the fact that the script can be configured
      only through a pile of command-line switches at launch-time, and
      features no real logging of any kind, rather gives one the
      impression that the Volity team hasn't spent much time
      developing the server executable yet, eh? Fear not; if you're
      reading these words, you're either an early adopter who can ask
      the core designers for personal help getting your game to work,
      or you're reading some hideously outdated version of this
      document and should <ulink
      url="http://volity.org/docs/devguide_perl">go check for a more
      recent version</ulink>. In either case, you can expect to see a
      much friendlier server interface in the near future.
