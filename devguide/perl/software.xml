      That done, get yourself a copy of Frivolity, a collection of Perl
      libraries and programs for creating Volity modules and then
      running then as servers on the Volity network. The most recent
      version is always available as an easy-to-install tarball from
      <ulink url="http://volity.org">the Volity.org
      website</ulink>. Even though you'll be working principally with
      only the Volity::Player and Volity::Game packages, they depend on
      other modules within the Volity namespace, so you'll want to
      install the whole shebang.
