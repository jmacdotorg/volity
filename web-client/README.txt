--- WHAT IS THIS? ---

This is the source code to as as-yet unnamed web client for Volity. 

This code is extraordinarily pre-alpha. We have no idea where this is
going to land, folks! However, Volity's project manager, Jason
McIntosh, has made a priority of it going beta by the end of 2007.

This is all open-source under the LGPL (see LICENSE). 

If you want to see what a fully fledged Volity client looks like, we
refer you to Gamut, a Java-based application. It's downloadable from
volity.net, and its source is available from volity.org.
