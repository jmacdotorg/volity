--- WHAT IS THIS? ---

This is the source code to as as-yet unnamed web client for Volity. 

Here bits receiving the most attention right now:

* The testbench subdirectory contains a web-based application for UI
development, and Tic Tac Toe examples in multiple UI formats. See the
README.txt and documentation.html files there.

* The Volity-WebClient directory contains a set of Perl modules
implementing the web client's server-side component.

--- STATUS ---

For the most part, this code is PRE-ALPHA. (If you want to split
hairs, the contents of the testbench/ subdirectory are just plain old
ALPHA.) Volity's project manager, Jason McIntosh, has made a priority
of it going beta by the end of 2007.

If you want to see what a fully fledged Volity client looks like, we
refer you to Gamut, a Java-based application. It's downloadable from
http://volity.net, and its source is available from http://volity.org.
