<h1>Welcome to Volity Testbench</h1>

<p>
This is a browser-based application for testing HTML-based (or
HTML-embedded) <a target="_top" href="http://volity.net">Volity</a> UI
files. It is written and maintained by Jason McIntosh, and is based on
<a href="http://www.volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?Testbench"
target="_top">the orginal Testbench (for SVG-based UIs)</a> by Andrew
Plotkin.
</p>

<h2>Loading a UI file into Testbench</h2>
<p>
To load a UI bundle, place all of its files in the same directory as
<code>testbench.html</code>. These files must include a
<code>main.html</code> file as well as a <code>locale</code> directory
containing language-labeled subdirectories defining various
translations of the game's seats and tokens; you should have at least
one language-based set defined. <a target="_top"
href="http://www.volity.org/wiki/index.cgi?UI_File_Format">The Volity
wiki has more information about this particular file arrangement.</a>
</p>
<p>
Once the files are in place, open <code>testbench.html</code> in your
favorite browser. And by "favorite browser" I probably mean Firefox
with the Firebug plug-in installed.
</p>
<p>
The author recognizes that this requirement is fairly annoying, and
states that it is likely to change in future releases. That being
said, it works for now.
</p>

<h2>Seeing an example</h2>

<p>
The <code>examples</code> directory contains some Volity UI files you
can test. Currently these are limited to Tic Tac Toe interfaces
running in various formats, but this is enough to show off Testbench's
(and the web client's) flexibility.
</p>

<p>
To see an example of a pure HTML/CSS UI, copy the files
<code>main.html</code> and <code>ttt.css</code> and the directory
<code>locale</code> from the <code>examples/tic_tac_toe</code>
directory into Testbench's root directory. Open
<code>testbench.html</code> in your favorite browser. (If that doesn't
seem to work, please let me know.)
</p>

<h2>Another example: a Flash UI</h2>

<p>
Unlike the pure HTML example, the Flash example will work
<em>only</em> if you are running Testbench through a webserver. If you
just open <code>testbench.html</code> locally, then the SWF will load
but you won't get full interactivity with it.
</p>

<p>
After uploading all of Testbench to a webserver somewhere, copy the
files described in the previous section, but take them instead from
the <code>examples/tic_tac_toe_flash</code> subdirectory. Also,
include that directory's <code>ttt.swf</code> and <code>ttt.as</code>
files. (The other files are ActionScript and MXML source code, to
examine at your liesure.)
</p>

<p>
Note that the Flash is limited to the Tic Tac Toe game board itself;
the rest of the interface, including the Testbench controls, are the
same HTML-based components from the pure HTML example. This
demonstrates the modular way that UI files will work in the full web
client.
</p>

<h2>Writing UI files</h2>
<p>
For now, my best advice is to read <a
href="http://volity.org/docs/ui-guide/ui-guide-html/guide.html">Andrew
Plotkin's guide to creating an SVG UI</a>. The graphics language is
different but the core principles apply, including those involving the
use of ECMAScript (read: JavaScript).
</p>

<p>
As the Volity HTML client comes closer to fruition, making an
HTML-oriented version of this guide will become a greater
priority. (It will also cover creating UIs based around embedded Flash
or Java applets.)
</p>

<p>
Until then, looking at the Tic Tac Toe example might shine more light
on the subject.
</p>

<h2>Running HTML UI files in a Volity client</h2>
<p>
And here were come to the part where I really do have nothing to say,
since at the time of this writing (late May 2007) no real HTML client
exists for Volity. The only real development target in the Volity world is Gamut, a desktop application that works with SVG-based UIs.
</p>
<p>
However, the core Volity team is actively working on the web
client. Testbench is actually an initial step towards its realization,
with much of its JavaScript library work destined to become the core
of the full game-playing client as well.
</p>
<p>
To follow along with these developments, please visit
<a href="http://volity.net">http://volity.net</a> and get familiar with our forums, RSS feeds, and
wiki. Use them to stay abreast with new releases and other news
pertaining to Testbench and the rest of the web client project, and
watch as this documentation gradually grows less sparse and
apologetic.
