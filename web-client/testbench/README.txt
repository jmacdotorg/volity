--- WHAT IS THIS? ---

This is Testbench, a browser-based application for testing HTML-based
(or HTML-embedded) Volity UI files. It is written and maintained by
Jason McIntosh, and is based on the orginal Testbench (for SVG-based
UIs) by Andrew Plotkin.

Testbench allows for incremental testing of your user interface while
you develop it. It gives you a graphical interface for easily testing
your UI's various RPC and input handlers. Once everything works as you
expect in Testbench, the UI is ready to be loaded into a Volity HTML
client for playtesting.

--- RUNNING TESTBENCH ---

See documentation.html.

--- STATUS ---

This is ALPHA software; its interface is liable to change a lot before
going beta. However, the Volity protocol itself is beta and stable, so
any files that work in Testbench now will continue to work in future
releases. It's just the way you load those files into Testbench that's
bound to change.
